       "  'BODY': 'Good Morning, Asia. Here\\'s what\\'s making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk\\'s Crypto Daybook Americas. After a tense weekend that saw the U.S. bomb an Iranian nuclear site , bitcoin btc has regained its footing, hovering around $106K as Asia begins its Wednesday session and pushing past levels from earlier this month when Israel bombed Iran . Part of the reason why crypto has recovered alongside traditional markets is just how correlated the two have become. \"Bitcoin’s sensitivity to traditional asset classes and macroeconomic indicators has evolved markedly over the past few market cycles, reflecting its growing integration into the broader macro-financial system,\" a recent report from Glassnode and Avenir Group reads. \"Institutional infrastructure has reshaped how capital engages with bitcoin. As a result, its market behavior is increasingly governed by structural liquidity, long-horizon positioning, and regulated access points.\" That institutional backbone was visible again this week. Semir Gabeljic, director of capital formation and investment strategy at Pythagoras Investments, cited ETF flows as a major tailwind: \"The huge recent capital inflows in Bitcoin ETFs of $1.1 billion last week and even $350 million today alone\" are driving the positive trend. Spencer Yang, Core Contributor to Fractal Bitcoin, added that one of the reasons why BTC was able to shake off war jitters so quickly is that fundamentally, nothing has changed about the asset class due to the conflict in the Middle East. All the metrics that investors would look to for BTC are still there, and other bullish market sentiment is possibly on the way. “We’re seeing continued interest in protocols like BRC-20, especially with the recent upgrade, as well as Runes and Alkanes, which have been getting a lot of attention,\" he added. \"So overall, on‑chain activity across the board is increasing thanks to these types of assets.” The takeaway? As bitcoin becomes increasingly defined by institutional demand and macro liquidity cycles, analysts see its price action as less about reacting to headlines and more about long-term capital commitment. This structural shift is what continues to anchor BTC above $100K, despite the noise. Tim Draper: Bitcoin Is Eating Crypto as Innovation Flocks to BTC The Bitcoin blockchain is becoming the new home for crypto innovation, absorbing ideas once exclusive to altcoins, just as Microsoft once consolidated the software revolution under its operating system empire, Tim Draper argued in a recent post on X . Draper pointed to BTC dominance , a metric equivalent to its \"market share,\" rising over 60%,up from 40% after the 2017 boom-bust cycle and 50% following the 2021 peak, as proof that Bitcoin is reasserting control over the broader crypto ecosystem. Much like how Microsoft integrated or cloned early success stories like Lotus 1-2-3, WordPerfect, and PowerPoint to form its software suite, Draper says Bitcoin is now incorporating once-altcoin-exclusive innovations: smart contracts, DeFi, ordinals, and low-cost layer 2s. “All the successful innovations on other platforms are now being ported to Bitcoin,” Draper wrote, calling it an “acceleration” that mirrors Big Tech consolidation. Developers, he said, are increasingly gravitating toward Bitcoin as the most secure and valuable chain. Draper, who runs a Bitcoin-focused accelerator with Boost VC, said the next generation of entrepreneurs is building on Bitcoin not just for ideological reasons, but because the infrastructure and ecosystem are now ready. “Smart entrepreneurs are always building on the platform with the strongest gravitational pull,” he wrote. “That platform is Bitcoin.” WazirX Granted Extension to Present Revised Restructuring Plan WazirX has received a court-approved extension from the Singapore High Court , allowing it to present further arguments in support of its proposed Scheme of Arrangement. The court also extended the moratorium on creditor actions, which will now remain in place until a ruling is issued on the revised plan. In a statement released Monday, the exchange said it is awaiting further directions from the court and reiterated its commitment to resolving outstanding claims. The company’s original restructuring plan, rejected by the court last month, as CoinDesk previously reported , sought to reimburse users affected by a $234 million hack in July 2024 through the issuance of recovery tokens and a transfer of operations to a new entity, Zensui Corporation. More than 93% of creditors had approved the initial plan, but the court cited concerns around governance and transparency. Without an approved arrangement, WazirX faces the possibility of liquidation under Singapore’s Companies Act, which could lead to extended delays and reduced creditor recoveries. No date has been set for the next court hearing. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin surged past $106,000 after a ceasefire between Israel and Iran eased geopolitical tensions, triggering a breakout fueled by high-conviction buyers, bullish technical signals, and strong on-chain accumulation, while the broader CD20 index also climbed nearly 1% amid renewed market strength. ETH: Ethereum surged 4% to break above $2,450 as Trump’s announcement of an Israel-Iran ceasefire eased global tensions, triggering renewed institutional accumulation and strong on-chain buying momentum. Gold: Gold fell as much as 2% to $3,300 after Trump’s surprise Israel-Iran ceasefire announcement eased geopolitical tensions, weakening safe-haven demand even as the metal remains up over 25% year-to-date. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.12% as Asia-Pacific markets opened higher Wednesday, buoyed by the Israel-Iran ceasefire and new signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve. S&P 500: U.S. stocks surged Tuesday, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hitting their highest levels since February as a tech-led rally gained momentum amid growing optimism over a fragile U.S.-brokered Israel-Iran ceasefire.

       "  'BODY': 'Bitcoin mining firm Hut 8 (HUT) said on Tuesday that it expanded its bitcoin-backed credit facility with Coinbase Credit to $130 million, up from $65 million. The amended agreement also comes with a fixed interest rate of 9% versus the previous floating rate of between 10.5% and 11.5%. The maturity of the facility was extended to July 16, 2026. “This facility has been an efficient source of capital on our balance sheet,” said Sean Glennan, Hut 8’s chief financial officer. “The combination of improved terms and collateral and borrower protections reflects our conviction that risk discipline is essential to building a resilient and efficient capital structure.” Unlike many traditional loans, this one is secured by bitcoin holdings. Coinbase, however, is restricted from rehypothecating the collateral, a measure that limits counterparty risk. The credit line also includes a limited recourse clause, further shielding Hut 8. The company said it will use the additional $65 million in capital to pursue expansion efforts. HUT shares are higher by 7.7% on Tuesday alongside gains for most of the bitcoin mining sector. Hut 8 operates a network of mining and data infrastructure assets across North America, with over 1,000 megawatts (MW) of energy capacity under management.',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Matter Labs, the developer firm behind the layer-2 network ZKsync, unveiled at the Permissionless conference its new cryptographic prover \"Airbender\" on Tuesday. A prover is a key component for layer-2s, as it generates zero-knowledge proofs that are then posted to the base layer blockchain (in this case Ethereum) — a crucial process in linking the two chains and ensuring its security. The ZKsync team claims that Airbender is the fastest of its kind, delivering Ethereum block proofs in 35 seconds with a single GPU, outpacing its competitors benchmarks. Having fast speeds can save on transaction fees: “we’re entering fraction of a cent territory which is critical for key use cases, including micropayments, high-frequency trading, and decentralized social,” said Alex Gluchowski, the co-founder of Matter Labs, in an interview with CoinDesk. “Faster proofs unlock faster finality, cheaper apps, and crucially, proofs that can be generated anywhere, not just in massive GPU farms.” The new prover, which is an open-sourced zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM), is based on RISC-V, a newer programming framework that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has suggested to replace the current EVM, because it will make the blockchain more efficient . “We started building ZKsync Airbender over a year ago because we saw where Ethereum needed to go, and what ZK apps would eventually demand,” said Gluchowski. “Vitalik’s recent post was a great affirmation of our plans, but this path has been in motion for a while.” While Airbender is still early in its rollout, Matter Labs has released an app that lets developers test out the new prover. If all goes according to plan and the ZKsync governance process approves it, Airbender will be included in a protocol upgrade later this summer, according to Gluchowski. “ZKsync Airbender proves Ethereum blocks in 35 seconds using a single GPU. That’s the start of something ground-breaking: home-proving, real-time cross-chain UX, and ZK apps that can verify on the fly. This is the foundation for an Internet of verifiable, interconnected chains,” Gluchowksi said. Read more: Vitalik Buterin Proposes Replacing Ethereum’s EVM With RISC-V',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'We stream data. We stream music. We stream video. Thanks to stablecoins, we are about to start streaming the whole economy. U.S. dollar stablecoins recently hit a milestone–they represent about 1% of the U.S. money supply (based on the M2 measure). Not a big deal, you may be thinking, but in fact, it might become one in the near future. Stablecoins are growing at a phenomenal rate, about 55% per year. While that is unlikely to continue forever, it is not hard to foresee a future, less than a decade away, where stablecoins represent an amount equal to about 10% of the M1, which is defined as cash, notes, and \"easily accessible\" digital money like current bank accounts. Stablecoins are designed to be easily accessible and usable, which certainly seems like it would fit into that definition of the money supply. Indeed, on-chain services are starting to look a lot like standard banking services. Except they work faster and cost a lot less. Now, imagine if moving money around was, effectively, free, and instantaneous. Would you manage your money differently? You might. Indeed, global firms are already starting to think about it. Today, companies keep lots of money in lots of separate locations all around the world. It’s not particularly different to how they manage physical inventory. Since moving money across borders is expensive and slow, firms must keep a decent supply of cash on hand locally to pay bills. And, since customers do not necessarily pay invoices with absolute predictability, firms must keep a buffer of cash on hand to manage the variation between predictable costs, like payroll, and unpredictable revenues. Things may look different in the future. If it costs nothing to move money globally and it can be done nearly instantly, the size of those local buffers can be dramatically reduced. Instead of keeping two weeks\\' worth of expenses locally, including payroll, you might just choose to keep only a day\\'s worth on hand. A slightly larger cash pile can be kept centrally and sent out as needed. Companies could rebalance their global cash holdings every six hours. The result: a significant decrease in working capital requirements. What may start at a global level for large firms could spread quickly, and not just in the B2B space. Why not pay every employee every day for actual hours worked? Payday lenders make a fortune today tiding people over between weekly paychecks. Why not bill customers daily for electricity usage? Electric utilities today wait 30 days to bill you and wait another 30 days for you to pay. The gap between when you use power and when you pay for it can be up to 60 days. This sounds preposterous except that the math pencils out. At 5% interest rates, a $10 debt over the course of a year generates $0.50 in interest at current rates, which is about $0.04 per month. Each week of \"float\" you can save (or earn) is worth roughly $0.01. Given that payment costs on Ethereum Layer 2 networks are now routinely below $0.01, the answer is yes, it is worth it. Transaction costs are headed in only one direction, which means the economically efficient size and frequency of managing your money only gets more granular. We used to buy music. Then we downloaded it. Now we stream it. Once upon time, the idea of streaming music on demand – and all the bandwidth and computation needed to do that – was seen as ridiculous. Now, it is barely a drop in the bucket compared to video streaming. There is no reason to think payments are different. As with all technological revolutions, the starting point is always \"your mess for less.\"\\xa0Which is to say that the first thing people will do is take existing processes (like monthly billing) and just run them cheaper. Then it becomes your mess, but faster. Eventually, companies start re-imagining those processes in light of the new economics. Slashing working capital requirements could rearrange the economy in surprising ways. Many companies keep enough cash on hand to cover 12 weeks of expenses. U.S. firms have, in aggregate, about $2 trillion of cash on hand and $2.8 trillion in working capital loans outstanding. Shifting to a financial streaming model could literally free up trillions in capital for new investment. It could also change people\\'s behavior. The longer the time gap between an action and a reward, the harder it can be to get people to respond. Incentives for things like using services or energy at off-peak times might be much more effective when the payout is immediate. Nobody ever went wrong betting on instant gratification.

       "  'BODY': 'CleanSpark (CLSK), a U.S.-based bitcoin BTC mining firm, said Tuesday that it reached 50 exahashes per second (EH/s) of operational hashrate — a milestone that makes it one of the largest mining operations in the world. The company built and operates more than 30 sites across Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Wyoming. A vertically integrated setup gives CleanSpark control over energy procurement and operations, helping reduce costs and boost uptime. “It reflects years of focused strategy, disciplined execution, and a relentless commitment to doing things the right way,” said CEO Zach Bradford. Hashrate is a metric used to measure the computing power behind the Bitcoin network. The higher a given company’s hashrate, the higher its chances of earning bitcoin rewards. The firm is now preparing to scale up to 60 EH/s, with Bradford stating the company was in “escape velocity” mode. Meanwhile, CleanSpark’s Digital Asset Management arm has begun actively managing over 12,500 self-mined bitcoin to generate returns and support expansion without issuing new shares. “We’re mining bitcoin efficiently, holding it responsibly, and putting it to work in ways that drive shareholder value,” Bradford said.',\n",

       "  'BODY': \"Will tariffs end the golden age of bitcoin mining in America? After China banned crypto in the summer of 2021, a huge chunk of the mining industry was forced to relocate — to Kazakhstan, Russia, Canada and other countries with cheap electricity. The biggest beneficiary of this exodus, however, was the United States, which over the last four years has overtaken every other country in the world in terms of hashrate (meaning that more bitcoin is produced in the U.S. than anywhere else). Yet President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, unveiled on April 2 but paused for the time being, threaten to increase the costs of ASICs , the extremely powerful computers used to produce bitcoin. Only a handful of companies know how to build these ASICs, and the majority of their manufacturing facilities are located in Southeast Asia, in nations that face roughly 10% to 50% tariffs. While the new taxes probably won’t make it prohibitively expensive for U.S.-based miners to import new machines, they will likely slow down the industry’s expansion in the country, multiple experts told CoinDesk. “The U.S. is still going to be the major source of hashrate globally for the foreseeable future, but its overarching dominance will likely erode as bitcoin mining becomes a much more global business,” said Taras Kulyk, CEO of bitcoin hardware firm Synteq Digital. “We're certainly going to see U.S. hashrate plateau in terms of relative growth,” he added. “Other countries are coming into the space in a big way. Pakistan just announced it will dedicate two gigawatts of power to bitcoin mining. There are all sorts of projects happening in Ethiopia and abroad. They will certainly take up quite a bit of hashrate capacity growth.” Tariffs are only a piece of a much larger puzzle. Other factors, such as the enormous demand for new data centers dedicated to artificial intelligence (AI) and the diminishing number of ideal U.S. locations for firms to set up mining facilities, are likely to have a larger impact on a miner’s calculations when it comes to choosing a jurisdiction in which to operate. U.S.-based operations are still, in the short-term, able to tap into a robust secondary market in order to acquire mining rigs without paying tariffs. In the long-term, ASIC manufacturers are taking steps to produce their machines on U.S. soil. The consensus seems to be that, far from destroying bitcoin mining in the U.S., tariffs are simply shaping up to be a new variable that the quick-moving, hyper-competitive industry has to contend with. Biting the bullet Tariffs mostly presented a challenge to miners in April because of how sudden and steep they were. Miners and logistics companies rushed to push ASIC shipments into the U.S. before the policy’s implementation in order to avoid paying substantial taxes — only for the White House to push the deadline back a few months. Now, however, mining firms have adapted to the idea that imported ASICs will cost at least 10% more than they used to. But there is uncertainty as to whether this is the new normal. The Trump administration is still in the midst of trade negotiations, and the court system has yet to provide a definite ruling on the lawfulness of its new policies. “It’s likely going to take a long time for us to have a definitive answer on what tariffs will look like — at least until the Supreme Court weighs in,” Lauren Lin, head of hardware at bitcoin hardware firm Luxor Technology, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We expect it to take a few months, even over a year.” In the meantime, Luxor (which also runs a freight-forwarding business) isn’t seeing any signs of panic among its clients, though there has been an uptick in questions on how to prepare for Washington’s policy changes, according to Lin. Nor is the ASIC secondary market (where U.S.-based firms can acquire pre-owned, cheaper machines) slowing down, she said. In other words, miners are plodding along. But there are new difficulties, like the fact that tariffs also impact imported electrical hardware. Transformers, for example, are mostly manufactured overseas and were already difficult to obtain before April. Tariffs have only worsened the situation. This has been a bigger source of frustration for miners than tariffs on ASICs, according to an individual who works for a crypto trade organization. Overall, the White House’s initial tariffs on Southeast Asian nations should only be seen as a starting point for a policy that will likely evolve over time, Jeff LaBerge, head of capital markets and strategic initiatives at bitcoin miner Bitdeer, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We're pretty optimistic that there'll be a reasonable outcome at the end of this,” he said. Made in America The $30 billion ASIC market is dominated by Bitmain, a Chinese firm whose machines power roughly 80% of Bitcoin’s hashrate , according to TheMinerMag. Its competitors include MicroBT, Canaan and Bitdeer. These companies manufacture the vast majority of their ASICs in Malaysia, Thailand and China, though MicroBT already has at least one facility in Pennsylvania, and Bitmain announced in December that it was launching a new production line in the United States. Canaan has also completed a U.S. trial run, meaning that it now has the capacity to build ASICs in the country if it chooses to. The Trump administration’s tariffs are accomplishing one of their stated objectives (to boost U.S. industry) in that they’re incentivizing these ASIC manufacturers to scale up their operations in the country. Canaan told CoinDesk that, while production in the U.S. is costly, it brings the advantages of being geographically closer to their customers and of reducing supply chain risks. The firm said that it is currently exploring the possibility of partnering with existing U.S.-based manufacturers for its own purposes. MicroBT is also looking into ways to avoid tariffs by ramping up U.S. production. Bitdeer, a new but technologically advanced player in the ASIC scene , is looking at the situation as an opportunity to seize market share from the incumbents. “We'd like to migrate as much as we can to the U.S.,” LaBerge said. “It will take some time to ramp that up.” “Being a manufacturer and a miner gives us tremendous optionality, because we'll always have a home for the rigs that we produce, whether it's in our own data centers or with a third party,” he added. Bitdeer has mining operations in Texas and Ohio, among other locations. The heavyweight, Bitmain, has not communicated new plans to ramp up U.S. production since tariffs were announced in April. But the company will likely want to demonstrate that it’s building in the U.S. in accordance with the Trump administration’s goals, Synteq’s Kulyk said. Bitmain did not respond to a request for comment. In any case, the consensus seems to be that expanding production capacity in the U.S. will be a slow and costly process. “Whether we scale our machine manufacturing in the U.S. depends on our ability to cut costs as well as demand from our U.S. customers. If demand from U.S. customers is low, manufacturing here doesn't make sense,” Canaan told CoinDesk. “In addition, if tariffs on products from Southeast Asia [end up being] low, then we don't necessarily need to build up our manufacturing capabilities in the United States.” The end of a golden age? So miners are quickly adapting to the new reality of tariffs, and ASIC manufacturers look ready to ramp up local production. Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s U.S.-based hashrate ( currently worth over 40% of global hashrate ) is unlikely to keep growing as fast as it has in the last four years. For one thing, tariffs do have an impact. Bitcoin mining is a highly competitive industry, and companies are always looking for ways to cut costs. If the choice is between opening a new mining facility in Texas or in Ontario, tariffs may swing the decision in favour of the latter. More important, however, is the fact that it’s getting harder to find new U.S. locations that meet the necessary requirements for spinning up new bitcoin mining operations. “Most of the low-hanging fruit has been picked in the U.S.,” LaBerge said. Not to mention that competition has become more intense. Data centers dedicated to high-performance computing (HPC) are popping up all over the country in order to scale AI capabilities, and the industry’s major players — Microsoft, Meta, Google — are deep-pocketed. If a site is suitable for both mining and HPC, the miners are unlikely to win a bidding war. Nor would they necessarily want to. HPC data centers are more complex and capital intensive to build , but they also bring in much higher profits; this has led a number of bitcoin mining firms to diversify into AI. “HPC chasing electrons is the main theme for the next two to 10 years,” Kulyk told CoinDesk. “Bitcoin miners most certainly have targets on their backs for acquisition and consolidation in the space… As a sector, they will likely get eaten or absorbed into overall digital compute.” This phenomenon is likely to stay contained to the U.S. because of the technical sophistication required to build and run HPC centers. Political considerations also play a big part, considering the ongoing AI arms race between the U.S. and China. In other words, bitcoin miners outside of the U.S. won’t be impacted by the rapid growth of the HPC industry the same way. For U.S.-based miners, the path forward may no longer be expanding in terms of megawatts, but in terms of efficiency, according to LaBerge. “If you look at the global hashrate right now… the majority of rigs have an efficiency of 30 joules per terahash (J/TH) or higher,” he said. For comparison, Bitmain and Bitdeer’s latest generation machines are closer to 10 J/TH in efficiency. “In today’s economics, that’s marginally profitable at best.” “All of those rigs need to be refreshed,” he continued. “We see this as a $4-6 billion a year addressable market for the next three to five years.” CORRECTION (June 24, 2025, 16:30\\u202fUTC): Canaan isn't looking into building its own U.S.-based manufacturing facilities, as previously stated by the article, but is mulling the idea of partnering with existing U.S. manufacturers.\",\n",

       "  'BODY': 'SharpLink Gaming (SBET), a publicly-listed gaming tech company with a crypto strategy focused on ether ETH, said Tuesday it increased its treasury holdings of the second-largest cryptocurrency to 188,478 ETH. The Minneapolis-based firm bought 12,207 ETH for some $30.7 million between June 16 and June 20 at an average price of $2,513 per coin, according to a press release . To fund the purchase, SharpLink raised $27.7 million in net proceeds through its at-the-market (ATM) offering, selling over 2.5 million shares. SharpLink in one of the growing group of public companies that recently pivoted to add cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets, following the playbook of Michael Saylor\\'s bitcoin-focused Strategy (MSTR). The latest move follows a $450 million fundraising round earlier this month through a private round from a wide range of investors, including ConsenSys, Galaxy and Pantera Capital, to buy ETH. Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin also joined the firm as board chairman. The firm now claims the bragging right of being the largest publicly traded holder of ether globally with some $470 million in ETH at current prices. Since launching its ETH treasury strategy, the company said it has staked all its crypto stack earning 120 ETH in rewards. The company also reported a nearly 19% increase in ETH per share during that span. \"This move reflects our confidence in Ethereum’s utility and our commitment to exploring transformative technologies that can unlock new value for our business and stockholders, alike,\" Lubin said in a statement.

The unsecured notes will carry no coupon and can be swapped at any time for the company’s Nasdaq-traded Class A shares at an initial price of $20. If investors hold to term, Nano Labs must repay the principal in full. The firm said in a press release that the raise is the first step in a treasury program built around Binance’s BNB. The company intends to buy as much as $1 billion in BNB through note sales and other private placements, with a long-term goal of owning 5%–10% of the token’s circulating supply. BNB’s total market capitalization currently stands at $90.3 billion. Nano Labs will evaluate BNB’s security and value before making the move. The firm pointed out that the agreement isn’t yet closed. Nano Labs’ shares surged more than 100% since the announcement was made to now trade at $22. Its press release comes shortly after a group of former hedge fund executives revealed plans t o raise $100 million to buy BNB through a Nasdaq-listed shell company.\",\n",

       "  'BODY': \"Strategy (MSTR) is currently experiencing its lowest 10-day realized volatility since it first added bitcoin {BTC} to its balance sheet in 2020, according to Jeff Park , Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management. Realized volatility refers to the actual historical movement of an asset's price over a specific period, in this case ten days. It is calculated using past price data and indicates how much the price has fluctuated in reality, as opposed to how much it is expected to fluctuate in the future. In addition to subdued historical price swings, MSTR’s implied volatility (IV) currently sits at 48.33 percent , which is among the lowest levels recorded for the stock in recent years. Implied volatility reflects the market’s forecast of a stock’s future volatility, derived from options prices. A lower IV suggests the options market is anticipating smaller price movements going forward. For comparison, MSTR’s IV peaked at 225% in November 2024, during a sharp rally in bitcoin prices following Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory. At that time, bitcoin traded above $95,000 and MSTR’s share price surged from $350 to a high of $525. As of now, MSTR shares are trading at $367. MSTR currently holds 592,345 BTC , but last week added just 245 BTC, marking its smallest weekly purchase since March. This slowdown in accumulation may suggest a saturation point, particularly as other public companies globally begin to adopt bitcoin treasury strategies. Furthermore, capital flows appear to be rotating from MSTR to smaller bitcoin-holding companies, many of which are experiencing strong performance in both share price and trading volume. Among them are Canada's LQWD Technologies Corp, which has risen about three-fold in recent days on its BTC treasury strategy. Notably, this marks the fourth consecutive week in which MSTR has not utilized its at-the-market (ATM) equity offering program. As a result, the company now trades at a 1.83x multiple to its net asset value (NAV) in bitcoin terms, known as mNAV. This multiple is calculated by dividing the company's enterprise value by the market value of its bitcoin holdings. Is MSTR yesterday's news? Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, Strategy has benefited significantly in recent years from the company’s status as a high-beta, high-volatility proxy for bitcoin. This elevated volatility made MSTR particularly attractive to options traders and speculators, enabling outsized gains on both the upside and downside compared to BTC itself. However, as MSTR’s volatility compresses, that appeal may diminish. With less price movement, traders, investors, and speculators could begin reallocating capital to other, more volatile bitcoin-linked equities or assets that offer greater trading opportunities. In response, Strategy has also leaned into alternative financing strategies, including at-the-market offerings tied to its perpetual preferred stock tickers, STRK and STRF. These fixed-income products represent a strategic pivot, but whether they gain meaningful traction remains to be seen.\",\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Bitcoin BTC mining profitability rose by 18.2% in May, due to a 20% increase in the BTC price and a modest 3.5% gain in the network hashrate, investment bank Jefferies said in a research report on Monday. \"BTC\\'s rally follows the recent gold rally as investors seek inflation-protected assets in anticipation of ballooning fiscal deficits in the U.S., among other countries,\" analysts Jonathan Petersen and Jan Aygul wrote. Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. U.S.-listed mining companies mined 3,754 bitcoin in May versus 3,278 in April, the report said. The bank noted that North American miners made up 26.3% of the total network last month compared to 24.1% in April. MARA Holdings (MARA) mined the most crypto of the group, at 950 bitcoin, a 35% increase month-on-month, followed by CleanSpark (CLSK), which mined 694 tokens, the bank said. MARA\\'s installed hashrate remained the largest at 58.3 exahashes per second (EH/s). CleanSpark was second with 45.6 EH/s, the report noted. The bank reduced its MARA price target to $16 from $18, while reiterating its hold rating on the stock. Read more: Bitcoin Miners Just Had One of Their Best Quarters on Record, JPMorgan Says',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) \"Always fade geopolitics,\" the founders of the LondonCryptoClub newsletter said Monday as bitcoin BTC fell below $100,000 after Iran fired missiles at U.S. airbases in the Middle East. It looks like they were right. BTC quickly reversed its drop and has since topped $105,000, restoring spirits in the broader market, where VIRTUAL, JUP and SEI are flashing gains of over 20%, according to CoinDesk data. The path of least resistance appears to be to the higher side, with President Donald Trump announcing a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, although unconfirmed reports of fresh aggression by Tehran and a response from Jerusalem introduce a note of caution. Also supporting a gain: At least two Fed members appointed by Trump are now leaning in favor of a rate cut next month and the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency is studying the use of crypto holdings in the mortgage qualification process. Anthony Pompliano\\'s ProCap Financial plans to go public through a merger with Columbus Circle Capital, with a focus on bitcoin asset management and revenue generation. \"While the ceasefire optimism is driving short-term gains, the risk of renewed tensions remains elevated,\" Valentin Fournier, the lead research analyst at BRN, said in an email. \"That said, ETF inflows and ProCap’s IPO signal growing institutional demand, even near cycle highs — a strong vote of confidence for long-term upside.\" The U.S. Federal Reserve removed the concept of “reputational risk” from its formal bank supervision program, supposedly easing crypto banking restrictions. Bloomberg reported that VMS Group,\\xa0a multifamily office with just under $4 billion in assets under management, is considering a $10 million allocation to strategies managed by decentralized finance hedge fund Re7 Capital. In traditional markets, the dollar index fell to 98, extending Monday\\'s sell-off, while the price of gold dropped to its 50-day simple moving average at $3,318.

Faster blocks mean faster confirmations, with more frequent data updates for wallets, DeFi apps, and L2s — creating a smoother, more responsive blockchain. DeFi efficiency could improve as a result of tighter arbitrage windows, faster price discovery and lower trading fees due to higher liquidity in AMMs. Key timing changes include reducing block proposal time to 3 seconds, attestations to 1.5 seconds and aggregation to 1.5 seconds. Monnot argues Ethereum’s “service price” will rise, making it more competitive as a global settlement and confirmation layer. Potential drawbacks include bandwidth pressure, validator performance issues, and network instability if poorly implemented. The proposal targets the 2026 Glamsterdam upgrade, which focuses on gas optimizations and protocol-level speedups across the Ethereum blockchain.

       "  'BODY': \"Ethereum could soon run twice as fast. That’s according to a new proposal floated by core developer Barnabé Monnot to reduce the network’s slot time from 12 seconds to 6 seconds, effectively doubling the number of blocks produced per minute. The idea, part of EIP-7782 , could be included in the upcoming Glamsterdam upgrade slated for 2026. Proposals or publicly discussed ideas are commonplace in the blockchain world, and may not necessarily move to testing. If implemented, the proposal would reduce time across three key consensus steps: block proposals (3 seconds), attestations (1.5 seconds), and aggregation (1.5 seconds). That would shave 6 seconds off the current 12-second cycle. Faster blocks mean quicker confirmations, fresher onchain data for wallets and apps, and a more seamless experience for users. For the booming decentralized finance (DeFi) economy, that could translate to tighter arbitrage windows, lower trading fees, and higher liquidity — all of which improve market efficiency. However, not everyone may benefit. Slower validators could struggle to keep up with tighter deadlines, bandwidth requirements could increase, and poorly tested changes could risk network instability. The Glamsterdam hard fork is currently in the early planning stages, with a broader focus on gas optimizations and protocol efficiency.

       "  'BODY': \"Mining difficulty on the Bitcoin BTC blockchain is on course to drop by the most since July 2021 after the amount of mining power securing the network slid about 30% in two weeks. According to data from Mempool.space , a downward difficulty adjustment of around 9% is projected within the next five days. That would be the most since the China mining ban four years ago, when the hashrate, the total computational power used to mine blocks, plummeted 50% to 58 exahashes per second (EH/s) and bitcoin was trading near $30,000. The difficulty adjusts every 2,016 blocks to ensure that blocks continue to be mined at roughly 10-minute intervals. After the recent decline, the hashrate is now just under 700 EH/s, according to Glassnode data. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading recently around $105,300. Significant hashrate and difficulty corrections are not unusual during the northern hemisphere's summer. Elevated electricity prices, driven by higher air conditioning demand and strained power grids, often lead miners to temporarily shut off machines, especially older or less efficient ones. This seasonal pattern has been observed in several previous years. The anticipated drop in mining difficulty will provide meaningful relief for miners. The hashprice, or miner revenue per exahash, currently sits at $51.9. This metric reflects the estimated daily income in dollars a miner earns per EH/s contributed to the network, based on block rewards and transaction fees. As difficulty decreases, mining becomes easier, meaning miners can earn more revenue for the same amount of computational effort. Assuming bitcoin’s price and transaction fees remain stable or increase, the hashprice should rise significantly in the coming days, helping to offset recent profitability pressure.\",\n",

       "  'BODY': \"E-mini Nasdaq-100 (NDX) futures rose over 1% Tuesday, narrowly missing the record high $22,425 hit Dec. 17, according to data source TradingView, a sign that might embolden bitcoin BTC bulls because the two tend to move in tandem. More evidence comes from the daily chart of NDX futures, which flashed a bullish golden cross, with the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) moving above the 200-day line. A golden cross is a sign that the short-term trend is now outperforming the broader momentum with the potential to evolve into a major uptrend. According to an analysis by CNBC , the golden cross is a reliable indicator for the futures, with the index rising over 70% of the time after one appears. The index surged 34% to 18,328 in a year after the occurrence of the previous golden cross on March 13, 2023. Note that BTC's rally has stalled above $100,000 since it chalked out a golden cross on May 23. The moving average-based indicator has a mixed record of predicting price trends in the bitcoin market.\",\n",

       "  'BODY': \"Digital Asset, the builder of privacy-focused blockchain Canton Network, raised $135 million in a strategic funding round led by DRW Venture Capital and Tradeweb Markets, the companies said on Tuesday. The round also included a mix of big-name institutions from traditional finance and crypto, including BNP Paribas, Circle Ventures, Citadel Securities, Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), Virtu Financial, Paxos and others. Privacy has been a key consideration for enterprise users of blockchains, particularly banks and big financial institutions, stretching back a decade or more. Digital Asset’s Canton Network has kept configurable privacy at its forefront, courting companies including Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon to test real word assets (RWAs) on the platform. “Everybody can connect to Canton, but if I wanted to issue an asset on Canton, I can decide what are the privacy settings of that asset,” CEO Yuval Rooz said in an interview. “So I can have an asset on Canton with no privacy. That would look like Ethereum. On the same network, I can have an asset with full privacy that you wouldn't even know exists. These can all coexist on the network, and I can even compose a transaction across these two types of asset.” The capital raise will expand the reach of RWAs onto Canton, which currently includes bonds, money market funds, alternative funds, commodities, repurchase agreements (repos), mortgages, life insurance and annuities. “Today, major players from crypto and traditional finance have joined Digital Asset on its mission to catalyze the next evolution in markets,” said Don Wilson, the founder and CEO of DRW in a statement. “With trillions of dollars’ worth of real-world assets already leveraging the Canton Blockchain, this next round of funding creates significant momentum for the company, and cements Canton as the de facto protocol for global collateral mobility.”\",\n",

       "  'BODY': \"Metaplanet's (3350) board of directors has approved a capital injection of up to $5 billion for its U.S. subsidiary, Metaplanet Treasury Corp, in a bid to speed up its bitcoin BTC acquisition strategy. The Japanese hotel company set up its Florida-based subsidiary on May 1, aimed at expanding its global bitcoin treasury operations. The contribution is expected to significantly accelerate the implementation of its “555 million plan,” disclosed earlier on June 6, the company said in a statement . Metaplanet’s strategic objective is to accumulate up to 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, leveraging the deep capital markets and advanced institutional infrastructure in the U.S. to optimize acquisition and management processes. This U.S. expansion aligns with the company’s broader vision to establish a globally integrated treasury model that supports shareholder value, improves treasury yield efficiency and strengthens its leadership in bitcoin capital markets. The funding for this contribution will come from exercising the 20th to 22nd series of stock acquisition rights, and all proceeds will be directed toward additional bitcoin purchases. Importantly, there is no change to the previously disclosed intended use of funds. The financial impact on the company’s current fiscal year results is expected to be minimal, but Metaplanet has committed to promptly disclosing any material developments. Shares of the Tokyo-listed Metaplanet, the eighth largest corporate holder of bitcoin with 11,111 BTC, closed 7% lower on Tuesday.

       "  'SOURCE_ID': 5,\n",
       "  'BODY': 'Multiple analysts have repeatedly pointed to $120,000 as bitcoin\\'s BTC price target this year. Recent developments have strengthened that bullish case, driven by four key factors: the spot price, central bank policy, energy market trend, and technical setup. Let\\'s take a look at those in detail. BTC\\'s love affair with $100K Recently, a crypto trader said that the best marketing for any asset is its price, highlighting an idea which is similar to legendary trader George Soros\\' theory of reflexivity. Soros explained that market perceptions and prices create a feedback loop – higher prices attract more buyers, which in turn drive prices higher, often far beyond what fundamentals suggest. In this context, bitcoin\\'s resilience, marked by prices holding largely above $100,000 through the Iran-Israel conflict and the U.S. airstrike on Iran, is its strongest appeal. The steadfastness indicates underlying strength, which could reassure holders while attracting new buyers, potentially fueling the next leg higher in prices. Moreover, brief dips below $100,000 seen in the past 48 hours saw investors step in with bids, revealing the \"buy the dip mentality.\" \"We are seeing exchange outflows, so it is likely that people, regardless of being retail or institutions, are buying the dip. Generally, when it comes to war and other external factors that disrupt things globally, there tend to be heavy short-term dips, which later rebound depending on the severity and how the situation is communicated. So far, I\\'d say we are seeing the situation play out similarly here,\" Nicolai Soendergaard, research analyst at Nansen, told CoinDesk in an email Monday. Meanwhile, data tracked by Glassnode shows weak hands began selling on June 10, while conviction buyers resorted to bargain hunting. \"Since June 10, BTC investors classified as Loss Sellers rose 29% (from $74K to $95.6K), showing growing pressure on weak hands. But Conviction Buyers also increased, suggesting sentiment isn’t collapsing. Some are cutting losses - others are actively lowering their cost basis,\" Glassnode said on X. Trump seems to have found his doves Liquidity easing, represented by Fed rate cuts and other measures, typically bodes well for stocks and cryptocurrencies. Some Fed officials are warming up to the idea of a potential rate cut in July, which contradicts Chairman Jerome Powell\\'s data-dependent stance. \"Trump seems to have found his doves,\" ForexLive\\'s Chief Currency Analyst and Managing Editor, Adam Button wrote on Monda y after Federal Reserve\\xa0Governor\\xa0Michelle Bowman, a hawk, said the central bank should cut rates in July. Hawks are those who prefer tighter monetary policy and higher rates to temper inflation. Doves are policymakers preferring lower rates to support growth. Bowman said that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer and could be smaller than initially expected, adding that she would support lowering the interest rate next month, assuming inflation pressures remain contained. Fed Governor Christopher Waller voiced a similar opinion Friday, favoring a rate cut in July. \"Now, maybe it\\'s just a coincidence that two former hawks who are also Republicans are suddenly doves, but it\\'s starting to look like a MAGA takeover of the Fed. And if there\\'s one thing [President Donald] Trump has been consistent about through his entire career (and it might only be one single thing), it\\'s that he likes low interest rates,\" Button wrote. Chairman Powell\\'s semiannual monetary policy testimony to the U.S. Congress is due on Tuesday. Powell is likely to reiterate the Fed\\'s independence and data-dependent stance while potentially being grilled by Republicans for keeping rates elevated. Oil slide Never before has the crowd been so wrong on crude oil. On Sunday, the consensus was that the U.S. military strikes on Iran and Tehran\\'s potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz would send oil prices skywards. But on Monday, oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic crashed. The slide is good news for central banks fearing the second-order effects of the oil price spike seen late last week, and those expecting rate cuts. The second-order effects typically include increased transportation expenses, higher prices for goods reliant on oil-derived products, and potential wages, all leading to an overall increase in inflation. \"So much for the fear of second order effects of Oil that Central Bankers proclaim. Crude oil down 6.5% on the day and 15.41% YoY..that’s deflation,\" James E. Thorne, chief market strategist at Wellington Atlus, said on X . Bullish technical setup Momentum indicators – key moving averages – are once again aligned bullishly. The 100-day simple moving average (SMA) has just crossed above the 200-day SMA, weeks after the 50- and 200-day SMAs produced a bullish golden crossover. The result is that the three widely-tracked averages are stacked one above the other in a classic upward-sloping bullish momentum formation. A similar configuration emerged in November last year and remained intact throughout the entire rally from $70,000 to $100,000.',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Dogecoin surged 6.56% over the past 24 hours, bouncing from a two-month low of $0.1508 to a session high of $0.1632, as traders stepped in aggressively following a technical breakout. The move came amid heightened geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Iran, which triggered broad volatility across crypto markets but failed to derail DOGE’s momentum. The meme coin broke through a long-standing descending trendline, confirming a shift in short-term market structure. Hourly RSI readings recovered from oversold territory, while netflows turned neutral, suggesting that sell-side exhaustion may have run its course. News Background Global markets have been rattled by renewed military activity in the Middle East, with U.S. airstrikes in Iran over the weekend raising risk-off sentiment. Despite the wider crypto selloff, Dogecoin showed relative strength, recovering faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum and pushing past key resistance levels. Technical analysts note that the rally was driven by a sharp increase in trading activity, particularly during the 22:00 UTC hour, when volume surged past 800 million units and price spiked 3.77% in under 60 minutes. The breakout has sparked renewed discussion about a potential retest of the $0.17–$0.18 range if volume remains elevated and global risk sentiment stabilizes. Dogecoin’s network fundamentals also remain intact, with transaction volume and active wallet counts trending higher over the past week. While macro conditions remain fragile, the memecoin’s resilience is capturing renewed attention from traders betting on short-term altcoin rotation. Price Action Dogecoin traded in a broad range from $0.1508 to $0.1632 over the session, ultimately settling around $0.1615. The $0.150 zone acted as a springboard after the asset reached a local bottom following weeks of declining momentum. A clean break above $0.162 resistance has now established a short-term higher high, with $0.165 emerging as the next level to watch. The final hour of the session saw minor consolidation, with DOGE pulling back slightly from intraday highs and forming a potential bull flag above $0.161. Technical Analysis Recap • DOGE posted a 6.56% gain, rising from $0.153 to $0.1632 over 24 hours • Price broke above a descending trendline, confirming bullish breakout • Key support formed at $0.150 after a two-month low, with volume over 800M during rebound • $0.165 now acts as short-term resistance; $0.162 holding as support • RSI has exited oversold conditions; MACD signals a potential continuation • Final-hour pullback remains shallow, indicating healthy consolidation',\n",

       "  'BODY': \"A fragile calm swept across risk assets on Tuesday as U.S. President Donald Trump claimed to have brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, sparking a rally in crypto majors. “Officially, Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 24th Hour, an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World,” Trump said on his Truth Social account. Ether ETH, Solana's SOL SOL, and Cardano's ADA ADA surged around 7% in the past 24 hours. Ether climbed back above $2,400, while SOL and ADA rose over support at $140 and 50 cents respectively. Crypto trading volumes also rebounded after a brutal Sunday-Monday flush that saw nearly $600 million in long liquidations. XRP XRP, BNB Chain’s BNB BNB, and dogecoin DOGE also rose between 4%-6%. The broader CoinDesk 20 CD20}], a liquid index tracking the largest tokens, rose over 3%. The bounce followed a wave of macro relief. Brent crude slipped 1.8% and S&P 500 futures turned positive, even as the ceasefire lacked formal confirmation from either government. But traders were quick to rotate back into altcoins, betting on a volatility cooldown. “We think the market will soon normalize and move on from the latest geopolitical episode,” said Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus. “But we’re more worried about a bigger shake-out to stop out recent longs… and the negative FOMO signals from all the public companies looking to establish new BTC treasuries as their latest financial engineering gig,” Fan added. Meanwhile, Bitcoin {{BTC continues to consolidate near $105,000, testing overhead resistance as institutional flows hold steady. Some see structural strength in the asset's performance over the past few weeks. “Its ability to hold above $100K underscores resilience amid geopolitical and macro volatility,” said Kay Lu, CEO of HashKey Eco Labs, told CoinDesk. “As institutional inflows and ETF demand rebound, BTC’s decoupling from traditional risk-off signals suggests a maturing role as a macro hedge in the long term,” Lu added. Still, some traders caution that the next leg of the move could be driven by profit-taking, especially in overheated tokens, such as ether.

       "  'BODY': 'XRP is pushing higher despite escalating global turmoil, surging 11% over the past 24 hours to reclaim the $2 mark. The rally comes after a turbulent weekend driven by U.S. and Israeli military activity in the Middle East, which briefly pushed the token below key psychological support. Now back above $2.17, XRP is testing fresh resistance levels with high-volume support holding at $1.97. News Background Geopolitical tensions have gripped global markets, with crypto especially reactive to headlines involving Iran, Israel, and the U.S. XRP’s recent climb comes amid this volatility, showing relative strength despite the uncertain macro backdrop. Trading volumes surged as buyers stepped in at the $1.97 level, setting off a high-momentum breakout that topped out at $2.173. Some analysts now forecast a potential run toward $6 by the end of the month — though others warn a 25% correction to $1.55 remains possible. While sentiment is split, market data shows institutional players are still active. Futures open interest and volume are elevated, and on-chain flows suggest accumulation over distribution. The $2.13–$2.15 zone is now acting as immediate support, and the broader structure appears bullish if it holds. Price Action XRP climbed from $1.967 to $2.173 over the past day, posting a 10.5% range with bullish momentum concentrated in the late session. The decisive breakout came during the 22:00 hour with 217M volume — nearly 3x the average — establishing $2.06 as strong resistance. Buyers first stepped in at $1.97 around 17:00 with 130M in volume, setting the foundation for the surge. Price has since consolidated above $2.13, with $2.154–$2.156 emerging as a new support zone defended by bulls. In the last hour, XRP rose 1.2%, closing near highs after fending off a quick 1.7% pullback at 04:07. Volume peaked during upward movement (748K units), indicating likely accumulation rather than distribution. Technical Analysis Recap 24-hour price range: $1.967 – $2.173 (10.5%) Strong support confirmed at $1.97 and $2.154 Resistance zone formed at $2.06 and $2.173 Volume spike (217M) drove breakout at 22:00 Momentum remains intact above $2.13 with bullish consolidation',\n",

       "  'BODY': \"Ether (ETH) ETH is trading at $2,420, up 8.61% over the past 24 hours, after surging sharply in the hours following former U.S. President Donald Trump’s unexpected announcement of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. The move appears to have reversed recent war-driven market anxiety, fueling renewed bullish sentiment across crypto markets. At 10:02 p.m. UTC on June 23, Trump posted on Truth Social that a full ceasefire agreement had been reached by both Israel and Iran. According to his statement, each country would pause hostilities in coordinated stages: Iran would initiate a 12-hour ceasefire, followed by Israel, leading to a 24-hour complete cessation of the conflict. Trump described this as a successful conclusion to what he labeled a 12-day war — one he claimed could have escalated into a much longer and more devastating regional conflict. He praised both sides for choosing restraint and credited the agreement with averting further turmoil in the Middle East. The announcement injected a wave of optimism into the crypto market, especially for high-beta assets like ether. Prior to the rally, ETH had already been showing signs of strength, supported by steady whale accumulation. On-chain data shows over $265 million in ETH was acquired by large holders during the recent downturn, including a single wallet that purchased 47,070 ETH —r oughly $113 million — over a three-day period. Ethereum’s network fundamentals remain robust, with an average of 1 million new ETH wallet addresses created weekly since mid-May, representing a 50% year-over-year increase. With volatility receding and risk appetite returning, traders are now watching whether ETH can break through the next psychological threshold of $2,500. Technical Analysis Highlights ETH rallied 7.7% from $2,230 to $2,401 over the 24-hour analysis window. High-volume support formed between $2,220 and $2,230, with initial buying at $2,191.36. Price broke out above $2,400 during the 22:02–22:11 window as volume spiked to 28,149 ETH. Resistance at $2,275 flipped into support as buying momentum accelerated. ETH touched an intrahour high of $2,434.95 before entering a consolidation phase. Price action formed a potential bull flag as ETH traded between $2,390 and $2,402. Volume surged to 2.5x the 24-hour average in the final three hours of the session. Higher lows confirmed bullish structure throughout the uptrend.

Already bouncing in afternoon action, bitcoin BTC rose nearly another 3% on the news, topping $106,000 after having plunged to as low as $98,500 not much more than 24 hours ago. At press time, the price had pulled back a bit to $105,300. U.S. stock index futures posted gains of about 0.5% across the board and the price of crude oil tumbled further to just $65 per barrel after topping $75 earlier today. The move in some altcoins was more dramatic, with ether ETH, XRP XRP and solana SOL among those sporting 8%-10% gains. In the minutes following the president\\'s announcement there was some confusion as to whether there was indeed a ceasefire agreement, but Reuters is now reporting a senior Iranian official as saying Tehran has agreed to a proposed ceasefire with Israel.',\n",

       "  'BODY': \"Cipher Mining (CIFR) has begun bitcoin BTC production at its 300-megawatt (MW) Black Pearl facility in Texas, the company announced on Monday. The launch marks a key milestone for the firm, which now operates five active bitcoin mining data centers. Phase I of the site, currently running at 150 MW, has reached an initial hashrate of 2.5 exahashes per second (EH/s). That number is expected to rise to 9.6 EH/s by the end of the third quarter, as new mining rigs arrive and replace older units. Once fully operational, Cipher's total fleet will push toward a self-mining capacity of 23.1 EH/s. The company delivered the site in 16 months and credits its operational discipline for maintaining low production costs amid industry volatility. “We’re proud to be mining bitcoin ahead of schedule,” CEO Tyler Page said in a statement. Cipher’s broader infrastructure strategy includes a 2.6 gigawatt (GW) pipeline that may serve both high-performance computing (HPC) clients and bitcoin mining. As competition tightens in post-halving markets, scaling cheaply and quickly has become critical for public miners like Cipher trying to retain their edge. CIFR declined 6.9% on Monday during regular trading. Shares are higher by 1.9% after hours.\",\n",

Technical Analysis: Potentially strong support established at the $3.87-$3.89 zone with high-volume buying validation. Possible ascending channel formation with progressively higher lows at $4.012, $4.025, and $4.035. The resistance level was identified at $4.08-$4.10, and multiple tests suggested continued bullish pressure.

       "  'BODY': 'Texas has become the first U.S. state to create a publicly funded, stand-alone bitcoin BTC reserve after Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law over the weekend. The bill directs the state to establish a bitcoin reserve managed independently from the main treasury, joining a small but growing group of states exploring digital asset reserves. Unlike Arizona and New Hampshire, which passed similar legislation, Texas did not just authorize the reserve but is actively funding it. The state will be appropriating $10 million in order to purchase bitcoin for the reserve. The purchase \"represents just 0.0004% of the state\\'s budget but could create an outsized impact by sending the signal to investors and entrepreneurs alike that Texas understands that the future of finance is digital,\" Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, told CoinDesk. The news comes months after the Trump administration announced the creation of a national crypto reserve — though that vehicle is supposed to be funded in strictly budget-neutral ways, like through crypto asset seizures or by issuing crypto bonds . Abbott also signed bill HB 4488, a companion measure that protects the bitcoin reserve from routine ‘fund sweeps’ into the state’s general revenue. The legislation marks a shift in how states may begin treating digital assets — not just as speculative tools, but as sovereign financial instruments worth holding long-term.',\n",

After briefly sinking to $99,500, bitcoin has bounced back 2.9% in the last hour and is now trading at $102,400. The digital asset is still up 2.5% in the last 24 hours, while the CoinDesk 20 (an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins) has risen 2.1% in the same period of time. Bitcoin\\'s drop occurred as Iran retaliated against U.S. President Donald Trump\\'s administration\\'s weekend bombardment of three of its nuclear sites. The Middle Eastern nation carried out missile strikes against American bases in multiple Gulf countries, including Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. The attack on Qatar resulted in no casualties or injuries, according to a Qatari official. Investors appeared to be unfazed by the military action. Gold, a traditional haven assets, barely inched higher at around $3,380, while crude oil prices plummeted 4% during the day. \"Crude getting crushed. Good sign,\" Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, noted in an X post . \"Generally when it comes to war and other external factors that disrupt things globally, there tends to be heavy short-term dips which later rebound depending on the severity as well as how things are communicated,\" said Nicolai Søndergaard, research analyst at blockchain analytics firm Nansen. \"So far I\\'d say we are seeing the situation play out similarly here.\" \"Smart money still seems to be going a bit more risk off,\" he said, adding that exchanges saw some notable outflows, suggesting opportunistic investors bought the dip in prices.',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Cryptocurrencies swung wildly during midday U.S. hours on Monday, with bitcoin BTC briefly sliding back below $100,000 on news reports that Iran could be preparing to attack U.S. bases in the Middle East. Other major cryptos also erased a part of their gains: Ethereum\\'s ether ETH fell below $2,200, while XRP XRP plunged back below $2 before stabilizing around those round-number levels. The broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index, having lost around 3% during the U.S. morning session, was still slightly up over the past 24 hours. At press time, bitcoin had returned to modestly above the $100,000 mark. The Sunday low in prices was at roughly $98,500. Axios reported that the Trump administration was preparing for Iran to attack U.S. bases in the Gulf in retaliation for the U.S. military bombarding three Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. American bases in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait were targeted. The report noted the president as imminently set to meet with his national security team to discuss the threat. \"Bitcoin’s recent fall is being driven by a potent mix of geopolitical tension and macro uncertainty,\" said Kirill Kretov, senior automation expert at CoinPanel. \"As conflict in the Middle East escalates, global risk appetite has sharply declined.\"',\n",

       "  'BODY': \"HIVE Digital Technologies (HIVE) has signed an agreement to buy a 7.2-megawatt data center in Toronto, Canada, aiming to transform it into a cornerstone for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure through its subsidiary BUZZ HPC. The facility is expected to become BUZZ HPC’s first Tier 3 data center. It will be upgraded to support liquid cooling and host up to 5,000 next-generation GPUs, enabling large-scale AI model training and inference. The company says the infrastructure will also support Canadian enterprise and government workloads, reinforcing the country's digital sovereignty. “With the explosion of demand for HPC and AI compute capacity, this Toronto site gives us a critical footprint to develop a sovereign AI data center — owned and operated in Canada by a Canadian public company — ensuring data residency, security, and national innovation leadership,” said Craig Tavares, president and chief operating officer of BUZZ HPC. The move comes amid a global race to build national AI infrastructure, with countries vying for compute capacity to keep up with the breakneck pace of generative AI development. The acquisition also signals BUZZ HPC’s first major step into operating its own facility. HIVE, which started as a crypto mining company, continues to shift toward AI and cloud services, with a particular focus on renewable-powered infrastructure. Other bitcoin miners such as Core Scientific (CORZ) have similarly diversified into the AI sector to boost their revenue stream.\",\n",

       "  'BODY': \"BNB saw a modest gain of 2% in the past 24 hours, pushing past $627 before settling with firm support at $616.55. The move comes as the BNB Chain, the blockchain tied to BNB, saw its daily transactions nearly double to 17.6 million since mid-May, according to data from DeFiLlama . Crypto markets have been jittery amid escalating geopolitical tensions and shifting trade policies between major economies. One factor helping to buoy sentiment is the upcoming Maxwell hard fork , scheduled for June 30. If successful, it will reduce block times from 1.5 seconds to 0.75 seconds, potentially making the network more competitive with high-speed chains. If momentum continues, BNB may attempt to reclaim the $650 level and push toward $700. But much will depend on how users respond to the technical upgrades and how the geopolitical situation develops. Technical Analysis Overview BNB formed a strong uptrend, with notable volume support that helped establish a key support level at $616.55, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. The most significant breakout came as the price surged through resistance at $624.59 and reached the session high of $627.85. After several hours consolidating between $620 and $625, BNB broke resistance at $625.24, signaling potential for further upside into the $630–$635 range. BNB rallied from $619.31 to $627.03, adding 1.25% in a sharp upward move that reinforced bullish momentum, before seeing a decline to now stand at $621.6.\",\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Midnight Network, a privacy-focused blockchain leveraging zero-knowledge smart contracts, published its tokenomics paper and unveiled its \\'Glacier Drop\\' airdrop mechanism in advance of claims for the native NIGHT token starting next month. The project said Glacier Drop is a novel process that allocates all NIGHT tokens to users across eight major blockchain ecosystems and rolls out in three sequential phases. The tokens will be available on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, Binance Chain, Brave, Ripple and Avalanche, the company said in a press release Monday. First, during a 60-day claim period starting in July, eligible wallets, those holding at least $100 in native tokens at the time of a pre-announced snapshot, can claim their full allocation. That is followed by a 30-day Scavenger Mine phase, which redistributes any unclaimed tokens to participants who complete computational tasks using a proof-of-work-like mechanism. After the network’s mainnet launch later this year, a four-year Lost-and-Found phase will allow original claimants who missed the initial window to recover part of their allocation through self-directed verification. To avoid supply shocks, NIGHT tokens will unlock in four randomized installments over a 360-day period. This \"thawing mechanism\" is intended to damp volatility and promote long-term engagement with the network. Fahmi Syed, president of the Cayman-based Midnight Foundation, which oversees the project, said the approach reflects the network’s broader vision of \"rational privacy,\" giving developers granular control over what data is shared on-chain. The eligibility snapshot has already taken place, and more information is available at midnight.network .',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Decentralized trading venue GTE has raised $15 million in a Series A round led by Paradigm, according to an announcement made on X. GTE describes itself as the \"world\\'s fastest decentralized exchange,\" a label often attributed to HyperLiquid. The derivatives exchange is one of this crypto cycle\\'s success stories, having racked up more than $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume in 2025, DefiLlama data shows . While GTE plans to rival HyperLiquid in terms of speed, it also wants to target Uniswap and Pancake Swap to make spot trades cheaper and more efficient. The GTE website shows that it will use a central limit order book to match buyers and sellers as opposed to Uniswap\\'s model, which involves liquidity pools and an automated market maker engine. GTE co-founder Enzo Coglitore said that he expects latency to rival that of Binance and Coinbase, in an interview with The Block . Trading firms have long since grappled with latency issues in crypto markets. Even FTX, once billed as the exchange built by traders for traders, had problems with high latency and API bugs. The difference between GTE and these centralized venues is that GTE will be entirely non-custodial. This means that traders can trade assets without handing over custody to the exchange itself, avoiding the risk of another exchange implosion like FTX .

       "  'BODY': \"Brazilian fintech firm Méliuz (CASH3), which serves over 30 million users in the country, has become Latin America’s largest publicly listed corporate holder of bitcoin BTC. The company said Monday that it acquired an additional 275.43 BTC for $28.61 million following a recent stock offering , raising its total holdings to 595.67 BTC. That stash, purchased at an average price of $102,702.84 per coin, places Méliuz 36th globally among all listed companies that hold the largest cryptocurrency, the company said. The company reported a BTC yield of 908%. The figure is a metric used to track its bitcoin per share that is commonly used among companies betting on a BTC-focused treasury, though companies may track the yield differently. Méliuz’ yield is notable and ranks it among the largest among bitcoin treasury companies, with The Blockchain Group recently reporting a 1,173% BTC yield . Strategy (MSTR), the world’s largest bitcoin holder, reported a 19.1% year-to-date yield, while Metaplanet (3350) reported 266.07% and Semler Scientific (SMLR) 26.7%. Méliuz's shares were recently 0.15% higher. Year-to-date, they're up nearly 160%.\",\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Canaan Inc. (CAN), the Singapore-based manufacturer of bitcoin mining machines, will wind down its artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductor business to refocus on its core crypto operations. Despite the growing trend of bitcoin miners diversifying their revenue through AI-related businesses, building AI chips is likely very competitive and not cost-effective for smaller companies. Canaan said that its AI unit, which brought in just about $900,000 in revenue in 2024 (versus total revenue of $269.3 million) and accounted for 15% of company-wide operating expenses, failed to align with the firm\\'s long-term strategy, the company said on Monday. “Doubling down on our core strengths in crypto infrastructure and bitcoin mining is the most strategic path forward,” CEO Nangeng Zhang said in the statement. Before the move, the company said it began exploring options for the AI unit as far back as March 2022, including selling it or shutting it down entirely. Now, Canaan expects to complete the phase-out in the coming months and anticipates a sharp drop in costs once the exit is finalized. Canaan is best known for its Avalon mining rigs, one of the earliest brands of ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miners built for bitcoin. The firm went public on Nasdaq in 2019 and continues to develop mining hardware while also expanding into self-mining and consumer mining products. The decision, which comes after years of trying to diversify into edge computing chips, is hardly a surprise given the recent focus of miners and mining chip makers on \" American Made \" bitcoin after Trump\\'s U.S. election win. Recently, Benchmark\\'s Mark Palmer wrote in his research that rig maker\\'s shares don\\'t reflect upside potential from the expansion of the company\\'s self-mining operations, especially in the United States. Canaan\\'s shares were slightly down on Monday, while the broader digital assets and equities markets were mostly positive. The stock fell 71% this year, while a bitcoin mining ETF, WGMI, declined about 20%. CORRECTION (June 23, 17:17 UTC): Corrects 2024 total revenue number to $269.3 million.',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'In recent weeks, Congress has made historic strides toward securing America’s leadership in digital asset innovation. With the passage of the GENIUS Act , we’ve taken a major step toward ensuring that this emerging sector operates under clear, consistent rules—rules that protect consumers, encourage responsible innovation and strengthen national security. But make no mistake: this is just the beginning. As leaders who bring complementary perspectives—one from years shaping financial policy in the U.S. Senate, the other from decades in national security—we share a conviction: the United States must lead on Bitcoin and digital asset innovation. Clear, responsible rules will unlock economic opportunity, preserve privacy and protect against illicit finance. Washington’s approach must be rooted in both freedom and security—and we’re committed to advancing that balance. The GENIUS Act represents a major step forward in establishing guardrails for stablecoins—digital tokens backed 1:1 by dollars or dollar equivalents. It creates a clear pathway for both state and federal oversight, ensures stablecoin issuers meet transparency and reserve requirements and protects consumers without stifling innovation. With stablecoins playing an increasingly important role in global finance, this bipartisan bill gives the U.S. a competitive and credible framework to lead. Broader market structure reform is also essential. Congress must provide long-overdue clarity to the industry by distinguishing between digital assets that are securities and those that are commodities. Bills like the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act grant primary jurisdiction to the CFTC for digital asset commodities, give the SEC new consumer protection authority and lay the groundwork for responsible innovation across the digital asset ecosystem. For innovators, it’s a green light; for bad actors, a stop sign. It also sends a powerful message: the U.S. is ready to compete. Countries around the world are racing to attract crypto companies, talent and capital. We cannot afford to drive the next wave of financial infrastructure overseas because of outdated laws or regulatory hostility. While the digital asset ecosystem is broad and diverse, Bitcoin remains its foundation—our best chance to lead the world in building a decentralized monetary system rooted in liberty and individual sovereignty. This Congress, the BITCOIN Act was introduced in both the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives with the goal of clarifying Bitcoin’s status under federal law, advancing efforts to responsibly integrate it into our financial system and promoting its use as a secure and censorship-resistant reserve asset. But legislation like this doesn’t matter in theory—it matters in practice. And Michiganders are already paying attention. Just this year, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Lansing introduced a series of pro-crypto bills to protect consumers, promote transparency and create a “Cryptocurrency Bill of Rights.” The state also launched the Michigan Cryptocurrency and Financial Innovation Caucus to educate policymakers and support forward-thinking digital asset strategies. This includes a proposed state-run cryptocurrency reserve—a visionary approach that could help secure Michigan’s financial future. Wyoming has shown what’s possible when smart regulation meets innovation. The state has passed more than 30 digital asset laws in recent years, establishing a comprehensive framework for blockchain banks, digital property rights and tokenized finance. Michigan is now stepping up as a national leader in its own right—and we couldn’t be more encouraged. Still, major issues remain unsolved in Washington. We must pass a de minimis exemption to allow Americans to use Bitcoin for small everyday purchases without triggering burdensome tax reporting. We must end the double taxation of bitcoin—from mining to sale—and fix the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) to ensure that bitcoin is not penalized under the new regime. These aren’t niche issues—they’re foundational to ensuring Bitcoin can thrive as a tool for freedom and inclusion. What’s at stake is more than just a new asset class. It’s the future of financial sovereignty, national competitiveness and innovation itself. America must lead the world in building a digital economy that reflects our values: transparency, individual liberty and open access. The GENIUS Act is a major victory—but it’s not the final one. In the months ahead, we’ll continue working to enact smart, comprehensive rules to govern how digital assets are issued, traded, and regulated, address critical tax and regulatory issues and ensure that the United States remains the safest and most trusted home for Bitcoin and digital assets anywhere in the world. We’re just getting started—and we’re proud to have Michigan in the fight.',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Fiserv, a Fortune 500 payments and fintech giant that processes 90 billion transactions annually, unveiled plans on Monday to launch a new digital asset platform and stablecoin, joining a roster of traditional financial firms rushing to capitalize on the stablecoin boom. The FIUSD stablecoin, planned to debut later this year, will be available to Fiserv’s roughly 10,000 financial institution clients including regional banks and 6 million merchant locations, the firm said in a press release . The token will run on Solana SOL, a blockchain known for its speedy transactions, and will use back-end infrastructure from stablecoin issuers Circle (CRCL) and Paxos. According to the company, FIUSD will eventually interoperate with other leading stablecoins, while the platform will also explore using deposit tokens, or blockchain-based versions of customer deposits, Rather than trying to upend the current system, Fiserv is positioning FIUSD as a \"bank-friendly\" piece of infrastruture that works together with traditional payment rails, with built-in compliance, fraud and risk monitoring tools. In a separate announcement, Fiserv said it’s partnering with PayPal (PYPL) to link FIUSD with PayPal USD (PYUSD), enabling businesses and consumers to move stablecoins between platforms. The two firms aim to streamline cross-border transfers, payouts, and vendor payments using interoperable digital dollars, a press release said. \"Fiserv is uniquely positioned to advance stablecoin-powered payments and help democratize access to blockchain financial services,\" said Takis Georgakopoulos, chief operating officer of Fiserv. \"We believe FIUSD will provide our clients with the efficiency and optionality they need to thrive in the evolving banking and payments ecosystem.\" The move reflects a growing push among global banks and traditional financial behemoths to embed blockchain technology and stablecoins, a type of digital currency with prices anchored to an external asset such as fiat currencies, into their offerings. The trend is accelerating as the U.S. Senate passed the so-called GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins. For example, JP Morgan unveiled a deposit token JPMD for institutional clients with a test transaction on Ethereum layer-2 Base.

       "  'BODY': 'Anthony Pompliano is taking his bitcoin-native financial platform ProCap BTC public through a $1 billion merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. I (CCCM), a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by an affiliate of Cohen & Company. The transaction, announced Monday, positions the new entity, ProCap Financial, Inc., as one of the largest bitcoin treasuries ever to hit public markets. In what’s being called the largest initial fundraise for a public bitcoin BTC treasury company to date, ProCap raised $550 million in preferred equity and secured $225 million in convertible notes, giving future shareholders immediate exposure to bitcoin through a structure designed to acquire BTC ahead of the deal\\'s close. Led by Pompliano, a well-known investor and vocal bitcoin advocate, ProCap aims to operate at the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance. The company plans to generate profit not just by holding BTC but by actively deploying its bitcoin balance sheet across yield-generating strategies that mitigate risk and capitalize on crypto-financial infrastructure. \"The legacy financial system is being disrupted by bitcoin,\" Pompliano said in a statement. \"ProCap Financial represents our solution to the increasing demand for bitcoin-native financial services among sophisticated investors.\" The merger values the combined entity at up to $1 billion, depending on the final bitcoin purchase price at closing. ProCap’s BTC assets will be custodied until the transaction completes, giving investors near-instant BTC exposure without waiting for the company to go public. The transaction is expected to close before the end of 2025, pending SEC review and shareholder approval. The Financial Times first reported that Pompliano was set to become the CEO of ProCap BTC, and that the company was planning to raise $750 million to acquire bitcoin.

The startup’s main product is a modular vault framework that lets developers create smart contracts to manage yield strategies without exposing users to the complexity of DeFi, the firm said. The vaults, built on Veda’s BoringVault standard, support a range of applications including restaking tokens, yield-bearing stablecoins and on-chain savings accounts. Veda says it has processed deposits from more than 100,000 users across a growing network of DeFi protocols and fintech platforms since its debut in March 2024. These include products such as ether.fi’s eBTC and weETHs, Plasma’s Vault, and pre-deposit campaigns for Berachain and TAC. Wallets like Binance Wallet and Bybit Web3 are also integrating the infrastructure. Veda already oversees over $3.7 billion in total value locked and plans to partner with a top-five centralized crypto exchange in the near future, it added. The raise also saw participation from Coinbase Ventures, Animoca Ventures, GSR, Mantle EcoFund, BitGo, and Draper Dragon among others.',\n",

The token traded within a 6.5% range over the past 24 hours, bottoming out at $1.91 before climbing to a high of $2.04. A sharp V-shaped recovery pattern has emerged, with increasing volume suggesting accumulation following the dip. News Background Global markets remain rattled by geopolitical friction and trade uncertainty, triggering volatility across digital assets. XRP was no exception, briefly falling below the $2 threshold before mounting a recovery. That rebound has been bolstered by a massive spike in futures interest — nearly $3.96 billion in XRP derivatives changed hands, led by Binance (30.58%), Bybit, and OKX. Analysts see the surge as a sign of renewed institutional interest in the asset. ETF momentum is also building. In Canada, 3iQ and Purpose Investments have launched XRP ETFs on the Toronto Stock Exchange, while in the U.S., the SEC has opened a comment period on Franklin Templeton’s proposed XRP ETF — a move that could hint at regulatory thawing. Traders are now watching to see whether XRP can build enough momentum to retest the next major resistance level at $2.14. Price Action XRP rebounded from a low of $1.912 to a high of $2.040, forming a consolidation pattern around the $2.000 mark. A V-shaped recovery began near $1.913, with the $2.020 level emerging as high-volume resistance during hours 22–23. The $2.000 area remains a key pivot zone, with near-term resistance at $2.003 and volume-backed support at $1.989. Price action in the final hours showed narrowing volatility — a potential sign of further consolidation or breakout prep. Technical Analysis Recap 24-hour price range: $1.912–$2.040 (6.5%) Resistance confirmed at $2.020 with above-average volume $2.000 remains key psychological level; support held at $1.989 V-shaped recovery pattern suggests buyer momentum Futures volume surged to $3.96B, indicating heavy derivatives activity',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Norway’s Labour Party government has revealed plans to impose a temporary ban on any new crypto mining data centres that use energy‑heavy proof‑of‑work systems, per Reuters . The proposed rule could kick in Autumn 2025, if approved, and is aimed at preserving electricity capacity for more productive industries. “Cryptocurrency mining is very power-intensive and generates little in the way of jobs and income for the local community,” said Minister for Digitalization Karianne Tung, adding the move reflects the government’s “clear intention to limit the mining of cryptocurrency in Norway as much as possible.” Norway, with its vast renewable hydropower resources, has long attracted Bitcoin miners seeking low‑cost, clean energy. Companies like Kryptovault have established operations outside Oslo — running data centres up to 40\\u202fMW, recycling heat to dry wood or warm nearby buildings. Despite the renewable backdrop, mining farms require continuous, high-capacity power resources that regulators increasingly view as better deployed to manufacturing, heating, or AI data workloads.',\n",

       "  'BODY': \"Shiba Inu's SHIB v-shaped price recovery from 16-month lows is characterized by a surge in trading volumes, according to CoinDesk's AI research. The meme cryptocurrency has bounced to $0.0000$1080, having hit a low of $0.00001025 late Sunday. That was the lowest level since February 2024, according to data source TradingView. The bounce comes as bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value retook the $100,000 handle after oil's largely muted response to the U.S. airstrikes on Iran. SHIB's recovery appears sustainable, driven by a surge in trading volumes. According to CoinDesk's AI insights, buying pressure emerged late Sunday, with volume exceeding 2 trillion SHIB, more than double the 24-hour average. The subsequent bounce, represented by a series of higher lows and higher highs, ran into resistance near $0.00001088 during Monday's Asian trading hours. Key AI insights SHIB has recovered from a significant dip to $0.00001008, stabilizing around $0.00001081 with strong volume support during the recovery phase. Geopolitical tensions and trade disputes continue to influence cryptocurrency markets, with SHIB's price action forming a clear V-shaped recovery pattern. Volume spiked to nearly 8 trillion units during the 11:05 candle, indicating strong market participation. A double-top pattern formed at around $0.00001083, with significant selling pressure at this resistance level. Hourly chart SHIB's price has taken out the descending trendline, characterizing the sell-off from Friday. Prices, however, are yet to cross above the Ichimoku cloud, a momentum indicator. That would confirm a bullish trend reversal.\",\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Crypto firm Unicoin has agreed to buy a 51% stake in Diamond Lake Minerals, a firm specializing in digital assets, setting the stage for a strategic rebrand and a shift into altcoin treasury. The deal, which was announced on Monday, will see Diamond Lake Minerals renamed to DiamondLake and refocussed on building a cryptocurrency treasury business. That effort is inspired by Strategy’s bitcoin BTC-heavy corporate treasury strategy but swaps BTC for emerging altcoins. Shares of Diamond Lake Minerals’ were last trading at $3.96, suggesting the deal could be worth above $70 million. The acquisition is expected to close within 20 days, pending standard conditions. Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin framed the move as a bet on the future of cryptocurrencies. He cited legislative shifts like the recent passage of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act through the country’s Senate as catalysts that could unlock altcoin potential. \"We believe the same results achieved with Bitcoin can be replicated at a fraction of the cost in the alt-coin segment,” Konanykhin said. DiamondLake’s CEO Brian J. Esposito called the deal “historic,” emphasizing the company’s long-standing ambition to bring tokenization into the core of public market investment strategies. The new company will focus on tokenizing real-world assets and making them accessible to everyday investors. The acquisition comes roughly a month after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Unicorn and three of its executives, including Konanykhin, for allegedly raising over $100 million in a “massive securities fraud.” The agency claims Unicoin misled investors by inflating real estate valuations and promoting outsized, unrealistic returns, such as a 9 million percent gain, through aggressive marketing campaigns. The SEC is seeking disgorgement and civil penalties. Konanykhin has dismissed the charges as “blatantly false,” and suggested the SEC is still going after crypto firms, even after the regulator dropped cases against firms including Coinbase, Kraken, and Uniswap. He rejected a proposed settlement meeting in April, calling the SEC’s terms “unacceptable.” In a letter to shareholders, he argued that Unicoin had complied with U.S. regulations and accused the regulator of inflicting “multi-billion-dollar damages” through its probe.',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Ether’s ETH recent rally may be on shaky ground with one firm warning that last week’s price surge was largely fueled by speculative futures positions instead of a bump in organic demand. In a note on Monday, Matrixport opined that “leveraged traders have pushed [ETH’s] price higher in the absence of fundamental support,” adding that this made the asset more susceptible to the “outsized decline” the asset saw over the weekend. Ether slumped over 8% in a Saturday sell-off, leading losses among majors as traders reacted to the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites in a surprise airstrike. The firm pointed to last week’s sharp drop in ETH as evidence of this position-driven fragility and warned that elevated leverage levels could continue to pressure prices. At press time, ETH traded near $2,248 — down from last week’s high above $2,400 — as derivatives data showed traders aggressively hedging downside risk. Options market signals echo that caution, as CoinDesk analyst Omkar Godbole noted over the weekend . According to data from Amberdata, ETH’s 25-delta risk reversals — a measure comparing the cost of puts versus calls — have skewed negative across June to July expiries. This suggests investors are paying up for protection against downside volatility. QCP Capital further noted in a weekend market update that “risk reversals in both BTC and ETH continue to show a preference for downside protection,” adding that long holders are actively hedging their spot exposure.

       "  'BODY': 'By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Markets are accustomed to violence in the Middle East. That, at least, is the conclusion you might draw from the way financial markets — especially oil — reacted to the U.S. airstrikes on Iran\\'s nuclear sites over the weekend and the threat of Iran blocking the key Strait of Hormuz shipping route. Both Brent and WTI crude gapped higher by just 3% early Monday and have since reversed gains alongside positive moves in bitcoin (BTC) and futures tied to the S&P 500. The dollar index is trading slightly higher and gold is nursing moderate losses. Long-term catalysts will overcome any bearish sentiment, said Valentine Fournier, an analyst at BRN. \"Despite short-term volatility and [short-lived] risk-off sentiment, long-term structural demand is growing stronger. Public entities like Texas and corporations like MetaPlanet are solidifying bitcoin’s position as a strategic reserve, laying the groundwork for a rebound once uncertainty fades,\" Fournier said in an email. \"We remain constructive on bitcoin’s resilience and believe Solana could outperform in a recovery. Ethereum has lost some institutional support short term, but may regain ground as volatility cools,\" Fournier added. Mean Theodorou, co-founder at crypto exchange Coinstash, said volatility could persist during the week ahead as macro conditions and political headlines remain in the drivers\\' seat, with all eyes fixated on the U.S.-Iran situation. Other observers pointed to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\\'s semiannual monetary policy testimony to Congress, scheduled for Tuesday, and Friday\\'s release of core PCE data as key events for the week. Theodorou said that altcoins may remain active as traders seek opportunities outside of major-cap tokens, although \"caution is warranted given recent price instability, with DOGE, ADA and SOL each posting steep double-digit losses, highlighting broad market de-risking as international conflict is set to dominate most decision making in the near-term.\" In other news, Tokyo-listed Metaplanet said it bought another 1,111 BTC. The cryptocurrency exchange OKX is reportedly considering an initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S. Grant Cardone, CEO of real estate investment firm Cardone Capital, disclosed that the company has added approximately 1,000 BTC to its balance sheet. As for the developing influence of artificial intelligence, popular AI agent Aixbt said decentralized perpetuals-focused exchange Hyperliquid has proved DeFi can outperform during real stress, referring the risk-off over the weekend. \"Next crisis gonna separate the platforms that actually work from the ones propped up by VC money and empty promises,\" the agent said.

The Ink Foundation announced a 1 billion fixed-supply INK token and a community airdrop via an Aave liquidity pool. Despite rising activity, Ink\\'s total value locked (TVL) remains under $8 million, signaling untapped growth potential. Ink started its mainnet in early December, beating its original Q1 2025 schedule. Fully EVM-compatible, Ink enables developers to migrate Ethereum apps for cheaper and faster execution. The network is part of Optimism’s Superchain, joining Base, Sony, Uniswap and others in a broader layer-2 (L2) ecosystem. The INK token will not be used for governance, but for incentivizing liquidity and app usage on the network. Derivatives Positioning Annualized BTC futures basis on offshore exchanges has dropped below 5%, nearly closing the gap with the 10-year U.S. Treasury note. Meanwhile, on the CME, basis remains steady around 7%. A similar dynamic is seen in the ether market. Funding rates for BTC and ETH were slightly positive, while TRX, BCH and XLM rates were deeply negative in a sign of bias for short positions. The price recovery from overnight lows looked shaky as the cumulative volume delta for most tokens, including BTC, was negative. A negative CVD indicates stronger selling pressure. On Deribit, near-dated puts traded at a premium to calls, reflecting downside fears, with bullishness emerging clearly only after September expiry. Market Movements BTC is down 2.03% from 4 p.m. ET Friday at $101,619.64 (24hrs: -0.9%) ETH is down 7.2% at $2,253.11 (24hrs: -0.34%) CoinDesk 20 is down 4.54% at 2,803.26 (24hrs: -0.9%) Ether CESR Composite Staking Rate is up 23 bps at 3.13% BTC funding rate is at 0.0007% (0.8191% annualized) on OKX DXY is up 0.60% at 99.29 Gold futures are down 0.16% at $3,380.20 Silver futures are up 0.26% at $36.11 Nikkei 225 closed down 0.13% at 38,354.09 Hang Seng closed up 0.67% at 23,689.13 FTSE is unchanged at 8,774.97 Euro Stoxx 50 is down 0.20% at 5,223.01 DJIA closed on Friday up 0.08% at 42,206.82 S&P 500 closed down 0.22% at 5,967.84 Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.51% at 19,447.41 S&P/TSX Composite closed down 0.03% at 26,497.57 S&P 40 Latin America closed down 0.83% at 2,592.58 U.S. 10-Year Treasury rate is up 1 bp at 4.39% E-mini S&P 500 futures are up 0.21% at 6,030.50 E-mini Nasdaq-100 futures are up 0.23% at 21,894.00 E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average Index are up 0.09% at 42,552.00 Bitcoin Stats BTC Dominance: 65.67% (-0.07%) Ethereum to bitcoin ratio: 0.02218 (0.59%) Hashrate (seven-day moving average): 835 EH/s Hashprice (spot): $50.94 Total Fees: 2.78 BTC / $282,367.38 CME Futures Open Interest: 149,590 BTC BTC priced in gold: 29.6 oz BTC vs gold market cap: 8.39% Technical Analysis The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the U.S. currency\\'s value against major peers, has risen past the trendline that characterizes the downtrend from January highs.

       "  'BODY': 'The short-term holder realized price (STH RP) for bitcoin BTC currently sits at $98,200, representing the average on-chain acquisition price for bitcoin {BTC} held outside of exchange reserves and moved within the last 155 days. This metric, derived using on-chain heuristics, helps distinguish between short and long-term holders and provides insight into market sentiment, according to Glassnode data. Realized price refers to the average acquisition price for the entire circulating bitcoin supply, based on the last time each coin moved on-chain. STH RP narrows this down to more recently active coins, which are statistically more likely to be spent. These are often the most sensitive to market volatility. Over the weekend, bitcoin dipped amid geopolitical tensions, driven by escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, and growing fears of escalation between U.S. and Iran. With traditional markets closed, investors responded by selling liquid assets like bitcoin not necessarily out of desire, but necessity. Historically, when bitcoin trades above the STH RP, it typically signals a bullish trend. Conversely, trading below the STH RP is often associated with bearish or consolidation phases. For example, from June to October 2024, ahead of the U.S. presidential election, bitcoin remained below the STH RP which was around $62,000 at the time. Similarly, in February to April 2025, prices again fell under this threshold which was around $92,000. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly, climbing back above $100,000 and now trading around $101,000. For bullish momentum to continue, it will be crucial for BTC to remain above the $98,200 STH RP level.',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'The calm in the oil market following the U.S. airstrike on Iran\\'s nuclear sites has dashed the forecasts of bears who predicted a slide in the price of bitcoin BTC. With this in mind, traders can look to the week\\'s major events that could affect markets. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\\'s semi-annual monetary policy testimony to Congress is likely to be the main event. Powell will probably be grilled by Republican party members for not cutting interest rates and \"costing the country hundreds of billions of dollars,\" as President Donald Trump has repeatedly said in his Truth Social posts. Powell, however, is expected to reiterate the Fed\\'s independence and the data-dependent path forward for rates. Traders will closely watch Powell\\'s take on the interest-rate trajectory, given the backdrop of Trump-appointed Fed Governor Christopher Waller\\'s recent comments that interest rates could be reduced in July. \"With the market\\'s pricing of future inflation well anchored, early cracks emerging in the labor market and housing activity evidently weak, there are reasons for the Fed to consider adopting a dovish shift in the July FOMC meeting and guiding towards a cut in September — a path already priced into the U.S. swaps market,\" Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said on X . Dovish hints could prompt more risk-taking in financial markets, boding well for BTC, which has held mainly above $100,000 throughout the recent escalation of conflict in the Middle East. Markets expect the Fed to deliver two 25 basis-point cuts this year, but the take is not unanimous/ \"We continue to think that clarity on the inflation story — whether tariffs are a one-off price shock or if they prompt more sustained inflation pressures — may not come before the December FOMC meeting, meaning we will see just one rate cut this year,\" analysts at ING said in a note to clients Friday. \"However, if the jobs market continues to weaken, that may well be a 50bp cut.\" Core PCE On the data front, the core personal-consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed\\'s preferred inflation measure, scheduled for release on Friday, is the marquee release. According to Pepperstone, the consensus is for the data to show a 0.1% month-on-month increase in May, resulting in an annualized growth rate of 2.6% and a three-month annualized rate of 1.6%. Expectations of a benign 0.1% increase support the Fed rate cut bets; however, according to ING, the inflationary impact of Trump\\'s tariffs is expected to kick in from July. Trump\\'s 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, announced in early April, is set to expire on July 9, following which the heavy \\'Liberation Day\\' tariffs take effect. So far, the president has made a deal with the U.K. and announced a trade framework with China. Beijing is yet to sign the deal and the European Union remains quiet. Iran tensions are not over yet While the oil market is calm for now, Iran could inflict damage even without closing the Strait of Hormuz, a trade route that carries about a fifth of the world\\'s oil. By constantly threatening the closure of the strait alone, Iran could push up shipping insurance costs, ultimately adding to oil prices. The cost to insure a vessel for the journey via the Strait of Hormuz has already risen from 20 cents a barrel to 80, a report by South China Morning Post said, quoting the Athens-based Xclusiv Shipbrokers. \"By planting enough belief that they could disrupt this key logistical channel, maritime costs could rise to the point that it would have a significant impact on the supply of crude and gas,\" Weston noted.',\n",

       "  'BODY': \"Ever since President Donald Trump's administration signaled favorable crypto regulations, banks, financial institutions and big fintech firms have been looking to bring funds on-chain, and seamlessly offer compliant access to decentralized finance (DeFi), according to blockchain development firm Alchemy. DeFi, traditionally a way for anonymous users to engage in a complex system of automated lending and borrowing of assets, can bring to a whole new audience of users to conventional finance (TradFi), with the possibility of compliance guardrails in place and abstracting away the headache of dealing in smart contracts. The common pattern is best described as growing a “DeFi mullet,” according to Alchemy, a picks and shovels provider for blockchain builders that has been described as the “ AWS of crypto ,” a reference to Amazon Web Services, the ubiquitous cloud computing platform that powers much of today's internet. “I see firms like Fidelity, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Revolut and Robinhood, who are all at different stages of evolution, but who all want to allow their users to take their funds, like their USD or like fiat money funds, and then use DeFi tools,” Alchemy CTO Guillaume Poncin said in an interview. “The common pattern is best described by the term ‘DeFi mullet.’ These are the most interesting use cases, I think, where you can use DeFi under the hood, and the user doesn't even really need to know that that's happening,” Poncin said. A concrete example of this type of thing is the way users of U.S.-listed exchange Coinbase (COIN) can easily get loans in exchange for locking up their bitcoin BTC, a type of margin loan that retail investors don't normally get access to, Poncin pointed out. “Now it should be possible for Fidelity to offer these types of margin loans against your money-market fund account, as an example,” Poncin said. “All of this is plumbed into [crypto] wallets and DeFi, so that as a user, it's just one click. You want a loan against your Vanguard holdings? Here is a loan.” “I think a lot of fintechs are looking at that as a great proof of concept of what can be done. if you're tokenizing your money-market fund or tokenizing your other assets, private equity, whatever, eventually what you want is to give your users utility over that. And the utility vehicle is DeFi.” Alchemy appeared around five years ago, offering a developer platform for firms looking to build large scale blockchain operations. The firm went on to offer programmable links between programs known as APIs, allowing for data indexing, smart contract automation and smart wallets that feel invisible and intuitive, Poncin said. APIs, in effect, put the software plumbing behind the scenes and ease the burden on end users. “The old school way with blockchain wallets would involve installing Metamask, but that’s a very cumbersome process,” Poncin said. “The new trend is, if you are Nike or Stripe, you want to provide crypto wallets to your users they don't even know about; they're completely invisible under-the-hood wallets.” CORRECT (June 23, 08:52 UTC): Corrects spelling of Revolut in fourth paragraph.\",\n",

       "  'BODY': \"Crypto traders are in a rebound mode after the panic selling over the weekend, triggered by U.S. military strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, forced massive liquidations. Solana SOL, XRP XRP, and Dogecoin DOGE, which were hardest-hit among the altcoins, are showing signs of recovery as leveraged bets reset and spot buying returns. Liquidations pause as market resets Over the last 24 hours, crypto markets absorbed another $642 million in liquidations, adding to the $595 million flushed on Saturday, bringing the two-day tally to over $1.2 billion. Bitcoin BTC led the bleeding, with $230 million in liquidated bets, followed by ether ETH at $188 million in long liquidations. While, SOL saw $28 million in liquidations, XRP took $21 million, and DOGE over $25 million. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open). A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction. The sell-offs began late Saturday after former U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed coordinated strikes on Iran’s key uranium enrichment sites. However, by Monday, the worst appeared to be over. Bitcoin clawed back to $101,237. Ether hovered near $2,236, SOL edged up to $133. While, XRP traded above $2, and DOGE hovered just around 15 cents. Losses persisted on the daily chart, but the bounce suggested dip buyers were stepping in fast. Analysts say institutional flows and growing use cases are helping some tokens snap back faster than others. Altcoins display resilience “While Bitcoin's volatility has been the focus after the U.S.-Iran escalation, the altcoin market is showing signs of divergent strength,” said Eugene Cheung, Chief Commercial Officer at OSL, said in a Telegram message. “Ethereum continues to attract institutional interest amid growing ETF inflows, while Solana and other Layer 1 tokens benefit from improving network activity, developer adoption, and ETF approval speculation,” Cheung added. Others say the market’s quick rebound reflects a broader belief that the geopolitical fallout will remain localized, with limited macro spillover. “The market is fairly optimistic that the Iran-Israeli conflict will remain muted and its economic impact will be locally contained,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. “We expect that Iran has to engage in some retaliatory measures to maintain its regime's legitimacy, but such measures will be limited to avoid pulling all parties into a protracted conflict,” Ruck added. Still, risks remain. The U.S. hinted at “far greater” military responses if Iran retaliates, and any disruption to oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz could shake broader markets. But the speed of recovery suggests crypto remains in a macro uptrend, and liquidations, can be viewed as entry points.\",\n",

       "  'BODY': 'American poet Charles Bukowski famously said: \"The crowd is always wrong,\" and his words seem to sum up the situation in the financial markets perfectly. Just 24 hours ago, social media was abuzz with fears that the U.S. airstrike on Iran\\'s nuclear sites, combined with the talk of Iran mulling the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, will trigger a massive surge in oil prices, leading to a slide in stocks and cryptocurrencies. The reality, however, has turned out to be different. Oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic gapped higher by just 3% and have since erased most of the gains, according to data source TradingView. As of writing, a barrel of Brent oil changed hands at $77, up just 1.4% for the day. Prices gapped higher to hit a five-month high of $77.79. Similarly, the West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) hit a high of $78.58 before falling back to $76.75. Meanwhile, bitcoin BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has risen back above $101,000, having hit lows under $98,000 on Sunday when fears of an oil price spike led to the short-term Deribit-listed BTC puts trading at an 8%-10% volatility premium to calls. Futures tied to the S&P 500 traded just 0.3% lower. The largely muted reaction in oil prices suggests that the market doesn\\'t expect Iran to follow through on its threats and block the Strait of Hormuz, which could destabilize its key allies in Asia, particularly China. \"Price action this morning suggests that the market doesn’t believe (at least not yet) that flows through Hormuz will be blocked. Brent is back below $80/bbl after briefly spiking above this level earlier in the trading session,\" analysts at ING said in a report to clients Monday. \"With more than 80% of oil flows through Hormuz ending up in Asia, the impact on the region would be larger than that on the US. Therefore, Iran would want to be careful in upsetting the likes of China by disrupting oil flows,\" ING added. According to energy market expert Anas Alhajji, Iran\\'s threat to close the Strait is largely a rhetorical tactic for domestic consumption, which it has employed at least 15 times since the 1980s. Alhajji explained the same in a post on X , revisiting the 2018 thread that detailed how blocking the strait is easier said than done. \"For Iran to close the Strait, it means occupation and the taking over of Oman\\'s waters where most ships go through. This will immediately invoke the defence pact of the GCC: it means war among all,\" the thread said, adding that a potential closure would hurt Iran\\'s friends more than its enemies, which do not import oil from Iran and could circumvent the Strait through two underutilized pipelines. BTC holds key support All this means that the much-feared oil price spike may not materialize soon, which could help BTC and other risk assets avoid a sell-off. A big surge in oil would increase the risk of major economies slipping into stagflation, the worst outcome for most assets, including bitcoin. BTC\\'s chart shows that bears failed to establish a foothold below the horizontal support at $100,430 on Sunday. Buyers stepped in around that level on June 5, taking prices higher to $110,000 in subsequent days. Oil\\'s muted reaction suggests the potential for history to repeat itself. On the flip side, acceptance under the support would shift the focus to the confluence of the 100- and 200-day simple moving averages at around $95,900.',\n",

       "  'BODY': \"Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins the trading week, bitcoin BTC is trading above $100,500 as the initial volatility from news over the weekend that the U.S. struck some of Iran's nuclear facilities begins to subside. While prices briefly dipped below six figures on Sunday in a risk-off reaction , markets have since stabilized. Equity futures are flat, and gold is up only marginally, suggesting that traders are not yet pricing in a broader escalation. The lack of follow-through in traditional markets may reflect expectations that Iran’s response will be contained or delayed, rather than immediate and destabilizing. Crude oil is holding its gains near $76 per barrel after spiking nearly 4% Sunday evening on fears that Iran could block the Strait of Hormuz, a key chokepoint for global oil shipments. Still, commentary from U.S. officials and muted early-week trading suggest that investors remain in a wait-and-see mode. In crypto markets, altcoins that had mirrored BTC’s weekend drop, like ether ETH, XRP XRP, and solana's SOL SOL, are also clawing back losses. For now, the market appears to be treating the U.S.-Iran clash as a geopolitical flashpoint, not a structural break. OKX Considering U.S. IPO: Report Crypto exchange OKX is considering a public listing in the U.S., according to a report from The Information . Earlier this year, the exchange announced a U.S. expansion after settling with the Department of Justice over accusations that it operated in the country without a money transmitter license. Among other crypto-linked companies, Bullish, a competitor to OKX and the parent company of CoinDesk, is also said to be considering an IPO given investors' appetite for companies with exposure to digital assets. OKX told CoinDesk it had no comment on the matter. Polymarket Bettors Less Certain About Second U.S. Strike on Iran Polymarket bettors are cooling to the idea that the U.S will hit Iran a second time before the end of the month. The 'yes' side of a contract asking if the U.S. will conduct another military action on Iran by June 30 is now trading at 54%, from 74% in the hours after the initial strike on Iranian nuclear sites. There appears to be a growing market belief that deconfliction – on both sides – is on the agenda, as evidenced by another contract asking bettors about the likelihood of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, which is currently trading at 49% down from 52% . Market Movements: BTC : Bitcoin rebounded to $101,419 after a volatile 4.5% intraday swing, finding strong support at $99,000 amid geopolitical tensions and surging institutional buying interest, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data. ETH: Ethereum fell 2.3% to $2,237 amid U.S.-Iran tensions, breaking a six-week consolidation pattern despite over $500 million in institutional accumulation. Gold: Bank of America analysts predict gold could hit $4,000 an ounce within a year, an 18% jump, driven less by geopolitical tensions and more by mounting U.S. fiscal debt and a global shift by central banks away from the dollar toward gold. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets fell Monday as the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites fueled oil price spikes and fears of broader Middle East escalation, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.56%.

       "  'BODY': 'Bitcoin BTC fell below $100,000 on Sunday, its lowest point since May, signalling risk aversion on Wall Street on Monday amid reports that Iran is leaning towards blocking the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait, located between Oman and Iran, connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, handling roughly 20% of the global oil trade. Reports of Iranian politicians mulling the closure of the Strait had observers worried about a significant spike in oil prices early Monday. \"After US strikes on Iran last night, 50+ large oil tankers were scrambling to leave the Strait of Hormuz. Markets have been closed, but an immediate drop in supply is expected to send prices higher. JP Morgan described this as their worst-case scenario in the Israel-Iran war,\" The Kobeissi Letter said on X. According to JPMorgan, oil could surge to $120-$130 per barrel in that scenario. That could potentially lift the U.S. inflation rate to 5%, the highest since March 2023. At the time, the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates. The losses in BTC weighed heavily over the broader crypto market, as usual, dragging major altcoins such as XRP, SOL, and ETH lower. The payments-focused XRP slipped 6% to $1.935, the lowest since April 10. Ethereum\\'s ether token slipped to levels seen in early May, according to CoinDesk data.',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Iran\\'s politicians leaned in favor of blocking the strategically important Strait of Hormuz on Sunday in response to the U.S. military strikes on the Iranian nuclear facilities, according to Saeed Azimi, Tehran correspondent for France 24. \"The MPs have unanimously reached this conclusion merely in a consultation capacity. The decision lies with the Supreme National Security Council,\" Azimi said on X , responding to several media reports , including Al Arabia , that the Parliament has approved the closure. The Strait, a key global oil shipping route, accounts for one-fifth of the world\\'s oil trade. Thus, the closure of the route is likely to send oil prices skyward, possibly into three figures, bolstering stagflation fears in oil-importing trade deficit nations like the U.S. Analysts expect Brent and WTI crude prices to open significantly higher on Monday, pricing a potential supply squeeze. In the meantime, an obscure token called the digital oil memecoin (OIL) has skyrocketed over 400% against USD, according to data source DEXTools.io . The token is listed on the Solana-based decentralized exchange Raydium. \"Fading the most geopolitically advantaged memecoin AND the ONLY coin endorsed by Peter Schiff himself? COULDN\\'T BE ME.... $OIL,\" an X handle supposedly associated with the memecoin, said on the social media platform.

Traders are now watching closely as XRP builds upward pressure near the $2.09 resistance line. News Background Market sentiment remains fragile as global economic uncertainty continues to weigh on risk assets. Trade tensions and policy shifts among major economies have pressured the broader crypto landscape, triggering liquidations and profit-taking across key tokens. Despite the volatility, XRP’s on-chain and technical metrics have held firm. The token continues to benefit from institutional narratives surrounding a potential spot ETF approval and Ripple’s global payments expansion. Analysts are focused on XRP’s ability to establish a new higher low, which could set the stage for a breakout if resistance at $2.09 is breached with volume confirmation. Price Action XRP posted a 6.33% range over the last 24 hours, sliding from $2.147 to $2.011 during a sharp sell-off centered around the 21:00 hour. Volume during that period spiked to over 163 million units, confirming intense downward pressure. The asset then recovered steadily, forming a higher low at $2.042 before pushing up to $2.083. In the final hour, XRP climbed from $2.078 to $2.089, marking the session’s high on a strong 1.38M volume burst at 06:20. This price action has formed a short-term ascending channel, with higher lows observed at $2.079, $2.082, and $2.083. Technical Analysis Recap XRP posted a 6.33% trading range from $2.147 to $2.011. Heaviest selling occurred at 21:00 with over 163M in volume. Higher low formed at $2.042; recovery to $2.083 suggests buyer control returning. Resistance now sits at $2.089–$2.090; support range firm at $2.011–$2.042. Final hour saw price jump to $2.089 on 1.38M volume at 06:20. Short-term ascending channel confirmed with sequential higher lows. Buyers consistently defended $2.082–$2.083 on minor pullbacks, signaling accumulation. MACD crossing into positive territory; RSI neutral at ~54 — conditions favor a continuation if resistance is cleared.',\n",

       "  'BODY': \"Bitcoin BTC rallied above $102,000 after briefly falling below $101,000 in a volatile session marked by unusually heavy trading, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Market participants reacted swiftly to the dip, which pushed BTC near the bottom of its month-long trading range. The reversal gained momentum as volume accelerated, leading to a strong rebound. The move coincided with a sharply worded post from James Lavish, a Managing Partner of the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, who wrote on X : “If you are selling Bitcoin because of the possibility of the world going to war, you have absolutely no idea what you own.” The $100K–$110K range has contained price movement for nearly a month. On-chain metrics suggest a balanced market with neither excessive profit-taking nor aggressive accumulation, while derivatives data indicates cautious sentiment with continued demand for downside protection. Technical Analysis Highlights A midnight push lifted BTC above $102,800 with trading volume peaking at 17,906 BTC. Between 05:57 and 06:00, BTC climbed from $102,767 to $102,912, supported by volume spikes over 150 BTC per minute. Peak recovery-period volume hit 184.24 BTC, helping drive price toward $102,990. Minute-level consolidation around $102,680–$102,720 preceded the breakout. A higher support level began forming near $102,870 as volatility decreased.

       "  'BODY': 'Crypto bulls were blindsided Friday after the U.S. military launched airstrikes on Iran’s key nuclear sites, triggering a sharp selloff and $595 million in long-position liquidations. The move, announced by former President Donald Trump, saw bombers hit Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan — three of Iran’s main uranium enrichment facilities. The geopolitical jolt rattled global markets and sent crypto into a tailspin on Sunday. In the past 24 hours, 172,853 traders were liquidated, with total losses hitting $681.8 million, meaning 87% of it was from longs. Ether (ETH) traders took the biggest hit with $282 million in liquidations, followed by bitcoin (BTC) tracked trades at $151 million.Futures tracking other majors, such as SOL, XRP, and DOGE also faced heavy losses, with at least over $22 million in losses. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open). A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction. Prices briefly plunged before stabilizing. Bitcoin held near $102,000, while Ethereum traded just above $2,280, both down intraday but avoiding freefall. Bybit and Binance accounted for two-thirds of all liquidations. And with the U.S. threatening “far greater” strikes, traders are likely bracing for more volatility.',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'The probability of Iran\\'s leadership blocking the Strait of Hormuz for shipping has increased following the U.S. airstrikes on Iran\\'s nuclear facilities. At press time, shares of the Yes side of the Polymarket-listed contract \"Will Iran Close the Strait of Hormuz before June 30 traded at 40 cents, representing a 40% probability. That\\'s a notable increase from 14% on Saturday. Meanwhile, the odds of the event occurring by the end of the year increased to 52%, up from 33% the previous day. Approximately 20 million barrels of oil are transported through the Strait of Hormuz daily, accounting for around 20% of the world\\'s oil consumption, according to the Middle East Forum Observer . Therefore, the potential closure of the Hormuz could trigger a sustained oil price shock. According to JPMorgan\\'s analysts , shutting the Strait of Hormuz could catapult crude oil prices to an eye-popping $120 to $130 per barrel. Such a spike in oil prices, coupled with the ongoing trade war, could lead to stagflation – the worst outcome for financial assets, including cryptocurrencies. As of writing, the cryptocurrency market has not shown any signs of panic, with bitcoin BTC continuing to trade above $100,000, per CoinDesk data. President Donald Trump confirmed airstrikes Saturday evening, saying the attack obliterated three critical Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities, calling \"the bully of the Middle East [Iran] to make peace.\"',\n",

       "  'BODY': \"The Czech government has weathered a political storm this week, surviving a no-confidence vote triggered by a $45 million bitcoin payment from a convicted criminal. The scandal has rocked Prime Minister Petr Fiala’s administration months before national elections, Reuters reports . The payment of 468 bitcoin was made to the state by a man previously jailed for running a darknet drug marketplace called Sheep Marketplace. The donation was accepted by then-Justice Minister Pavel Blazek, who later resigned amid the backlash , on behalf of the government. The bitcoin was sold for roughly 1 billion Czech koruna, worth around $45 million. Opposition party ANO, which leads polls ahead of the October vote, filed a no-confidence motion and accused the ruling coalition of potentially aiding in the laundering of illicit assets, as the source of the BTC is unclear. Critics say the government should have involved prosecutors or police instead of accepting potentially tainted crypto funds. After two days of debate, the motion failed in the lower house, where Fiala's coalition retains a majority. Still, Blazek insisted he acted legally in accepting the donation, which amounted to about 30% of crypto found on the man's returned devices. The donor’s motives remain unclear. The case shook the government of a country whose central bank earlier this year approved a proposal to study bitcoin as a reserve asset. Czech National Bank chief Ales Michl has even said bitcoin is not to be “lumped together” with crypto. Polymarket traders are currently seeing the main opposition party, ANO, win the parliamentary election in October. Perceived odds of that outcome are currently at 92% , while Blazek’s ODS party’s chances stand at just 6%.\",\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Savvy bitcoin BTC and ether ETH traders are shoring up their defenses as the broader market continues to foresee bullish price action over the summer. That\\'s the message from an options-based strategy called 25-delta risk reversal, which involves the simultaneous purchase of a put option and sale of a call, or vice versa. At the time of writing, risk reversals based on Deribit -listed bitcoin and ether options indicated that investors were positioning for downside volatility over the summer. BTC\\'s 25-delta risk reversals for June, July, and August tenors were negative, indicating a preference for put options, which offer downside protection, over calls or bullish bets, according to data source Amberdata . In ETH\\'s case, puts were pricier out to the July end expiry. Traders typically buy put options to hedge their long positions in the spot and futures markets, protecting themselves from potential price declines. \"Risk reversals in both BTC and ETH continue to show a preference for downside protection across June and September tenors. This suggests that long holders are actively hedging spot exposure and preparing for potential drawdowns,\" Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market note. The nervousness is evident from the over-the-counter liquidity platform Paradigm, where the top five BTC trades for the week include a put spread and a bearish risk reversal. Meanwhile, in ETH\\'s case, a long position in the $2,450 put crossed the tape alongside a short strangle (volatility) trade. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has spent over 40 days trading back and forth above $100,000, according to CoinDesk data. According to analysts , profit-taking by long-term holders and miner selling have counteracted the strong uptake for spot ETFs, leaving prices directionless. \"Bitcoin has recently tracked sideways, suggesting its current price may be too high for many retail investors. Open interest in BTC options has risen, with a positive and rising 25 delta put-call skew on 30-day contracts, which may imply that market participants are seeking short-term protection through put options,\" Coinbase Institutional\\'s weekly report noted. On Friday, BTC closed (UTC) below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) to trade below the key support for the first time since mid-April. The breakdown may lead to more chart-driven selling, potentially resulting in a drop below $100,000. Some observers, however, expect a rally to new record highs. According to market observer Cas Abbé , BTC\\'s on-balance volume continues to indicate strong buying pressure, suggesting that prices could rise to $130,000-$135,000 by the end of the third quarter.',\n",

       "  'BODY': \"BNB has fallen to $635, weathering a choppy market as traders brace for the Maxwell hard fork and rising geopolitical risk in the Middle East. The token’s resilience comes as daily transactions on the BNB Chain have surged from 8 million to 17.6 million since mid-May, according to DeFiLlama data. Scheduled for June 30, the Maxwell fork will reduce block times from 1.5 seconds to 0.75 seconds and bring in a series of improvements. It’s expected to improve transaction throughput and user experience. Investors are also reacting to mounting global uncertainty. Crude prices have surged more than 10% over the past week as markets weigh the possibility of the United States entering the Israel-Iran conflict. A shutdown of Iranian oil exports or closure of the Strait of Hormuz, Reuters reports , could drive oil to $130 a barrel, analysts at Oxford Economics warned. That could potentially push U.S. inflation to 6% and derail hopes for rate cuts this year. In that environment, risk assets like BNB can see a sell-off as investors move to risk-off positioning. Technical Analysis Overview BNB is trading within a narrow range between $635 and $646, with volume confirming a solid support base at $638, as confirmed by a spike in volume. Repeated attempts to break through resistance near $644.5–$645 failed, suggesting sellers are defending that zone, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. A volume burst of 4,222.99 tokens earlier corresponded with a rapid drop to $638, reinforcing that area as a support level that has now been breached as volumes tapered off for the weekend Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards .

       "  'BODY': \"Ether (ETH) ETH posted a modest recovery on Saturday after a volatile week marked by outsized institutional outflows. On Friday, June 20, spot ETH ETFs listed in the U.S. recorded $11.3 million in net outflows — the largest single-day decline in June, according to data from Farside Investors . The pullback was led by BlackRock’s ETHA ETF, which saw a $19.7 million outflow — its first and only negative flow this month. In contrast, Grayscale’s ETHE product attracted $6.6 million, and VanEck’s ETHV ETF added $1.8 million, partially offsetting losses. No other issuers recorded inflows or outflows. The data suggests large institutions may be reducing their ETH exposure, even as select funds like Grayscale continue to attract capital. The ETF flow figures emerged alongside a technical rebound in price. Ether briefly dipped to $2,372.85 on Friday in a heavy sell-off marked by a volume spike nearly five times the daily average, but swiftly recovered as buyers stepped in around the $2,420–$2,430 range, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. This area has since formed a solid support zone, validated by multiple low-volume tests suggesting accumulation. The 24-hour trading volume surged 18.97% above the 7-day moving average, reflecting elevated trading interest during the price recovery. ETH closed near $2,445 and formed an ascending trendline of higher lows, though key resistance remains at the $2,480–$2,500 level. Technical Analysis Highlights ETH-USD posted a 24-hour trading range of $186.44 (7.25%), with a steep sell-off to $2,372.85 marking the session low. The drop occurred during the 17:00 hour and was accompanied by a sharp spike in trading volume, reaching 993,622 units—nearly 5x the daily average. A key support zone formed between $2,420 and $2,430, reinforced by multiple successful retests with progressively lower sell-side volume. ETH reclaimed 38.2% of the Fibonacci retracement from the sell-off and built an ascending trendline supported by higher lows. During the 08:00–09:00 hour, volume accelerated again, signaling bullish momentum and lifting price toward the $2,445 level. In the final hour, ETH traded within a narrow $5.83 band, ranging from $2,440.14 to a close of $2,443.45. A late-session rally peaked at $2,447.02 (11:38), with an intra-candle volume burst of 4,532 units. The price then dipped slightly but found immediate support at $2,439.38, continuing to respect the ascending short-term trendline.

       "  'BODY': \"Bitcoin (BTC) BTC continues to struggle for direction amid mounting macroeconomic pressures and a notable deterioration in retail investor sentiment. The asset is hovering near $103,700 following a volatile 24-hour stretch, in which it briefly dropped below $103,400 before staging a modest recovery, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. This price behavior reflects an uneasy market backdrop, shaped by both geopolitical tensions and uncertain monetary policy. According to an X post by crypto analytics firm Santiment on Thursday, sentiment among retail investors has turned sharply negative. The firm reported that the ratio of bullish to bearish commentary has fallen to just 1.03 to 1 — the lowest since early April, when the President Donald Trump unveiled his so-called Liberation Day tariffs, triggering peak market fear at the time. Santiment emphasized that this current wave of retail pessimism is unusually intense and, based on past patterns, may mark a contrarian signal for a price rebound. They specifically noted that back in April, Bitcoin rallied shortly after similar fear levels surfaced, suggesting large investors often use periods of retail capitulation to accumulate at favorable prices. Adding to the pressure is the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, which has kept btcoin trading in a relatively tight $100,000 to $110,000 range over the past month. Meanwhile, on-chain metrics show declining open interest on Binance, pointing to continued deleveraging among derivatives traders. At the same time, whale wallets have shown steady accumulation since 2023 — an indication that large holders are continuing to build their positions despite the short-term uncertainty. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC-USD traded in a 24-hour range between $106,552.98 and $102,411.01, a 3.89% swing as volatility spiked midday. A sharp drop occurred between 14:00 and 17:00 UTC, pushing price below $104,000 and forming strong resistance near $106,000 on above-average volume. Support emerged between $103,000 and $103,500, where price consolidated on declining volume during the final eight hours of the analysis period. A V-shaped rebound developed late in the session, with BTC rising from $103,363 to $103,618 and establishing a local floor near $103,500. Short-term momentum indicators showed mild recovery as the session closed near intraday highs, but follow-through remained limited.

       "  'BODY': \"Odds are stacked that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approves most of the filed crypto exchange-traded funds, including the various XRP ETFs , by their respective deadlines, according to Bloomberg Analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas. “We are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher,” Bloomberg Intelligence’s James Seyffart said in a post on X . “Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion.” According to the analysts, ETFs for assets like Litecoin, Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano all now sit at or above the 90% mark. These estimates reflect growing optimism from ETF specialists following a wave of 19b-4 acknowledgements and S-1 amendment requests from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Analysts view this back-and-forth process as a signal that the SEC is now more willing to work with issuers. The only asset lagging behind is SUI , filed solely by Canary. Bloomberg assigns it a 60% chance of approval, citing a lack of regulated futures and regulatory uncertainty. Bettors on Polymarket are also feeling optimistic. They are giving a 98% chance that an XRP ETF gets approved this year, and a 91% chance a SOL ETF gets the green light. It's also likely that a DOGE ETF gets a go-ahead, with bettors giving that a 71% chance of happening.\",\n",

       "  'BODY': 'What started as a positive day for crypto markets quickly reversed during the U.S. session with bitcoin BTC sliding below $103,000 from the $106,500 level just hours earlier. At press time, bitcoin had pared some of the losses, returning to $103,200, down 1.2% over the past 24 hours. Other large cryptocurrencies endured steeper declines. Ethereum\\'s ether ETH saw a sharp 4.5% drop in just 90 minutes to as low as $2,372, with trading volume spiking to nearly 800,000 ETH, nearly eight times the average hourly volume, per CoinDesk data. Solana\\'s SOL SOL, dogecoin DOGE and Cardano\\'s ADA ADA were 3%-5% lower over the same period. The volatility burst caught many traders off-guard, liquidating about $450 million in derivatives trading positions on centralized exchanges across all digital assets, CoinGlass data shows. Some $387 million of liquidations were tied to long positions that bet on profiting from rising prices. While macro risks abound — among them the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran — there was no immediate external reason for the sudden price swing. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indexes only inched lower during the day. Bitcoin at stalemate Zooming out, BTC continues to trade within a sideways range between $100,000 and $110,000, consolidating just below its all-time record level. \"The mixed view of whether BTC will go above $110,000 again or drop into the $90,000 area doesn’t surprise me at all and underscores the overall indecision people and markets feel,\" said James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet. \"The present BTC stalemate reflects a market caught between bullish long-term sentiment and short-term macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty,\" he added.',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Stablecoins are enjoying a moment in U.S. policy circles as the Senate just passed a regulation bill with major bipartisan numbers. As that moment approached, President Donald Trump and his family apparently offloaded about 20% of their stake in the parent company controlling World Liberty Financial, a crypto business that includes its own stablecoin. DT Marks DEFI LLC is a company that now owns about 40% of the holding company over WLFI, down from an earlier 60%, according to the legal disclosures at the bottom of the platform\\'s website . DT Marks DEFI is \"an entity affiliated with Donald J. Trump and certain of his family members,\" it says. Trump\\'s crypto dealings are extensive and have reportedly directly gained him tens of millions of dollars, at least, but they\\'ve also taken a starring role in the debate over digital assets regulation in the U.S. The stablecoin bill that is now in the hands of the House of Representatives was temporarily stalled in the Senate as Democrats made noise about Trump\\'s own stablecoin operation. Despite corruption complaints from lawmakers such as Senators Elizabeth Warren, Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, and arguments that it\\'s inappropriate for the president to be taking a hand in the regulation of his own business, the advancement of the bill potentially leaves World Liberty Financial\\'s USD1 stablecoin approaching steadier footing, assuming the company is prepared to comply with rigorous reserve and oversight demands. While Trump\\'s political allies and his administration claim his business ties are transparent, the family\\'s crypto dealings remain murky, without full disclosures of the business stakes of individual members, including the president. It is still unclear what the family\\'s specific ownership or management involvement may be with World Liberty Financial. Representatives from WLFI and Trump\\'s business interests didn\\'t immediately respond to requests for comment from CoinDesk. And his growing ties to crypto don\\'t end there. Trump drew the bulk of recent criticism for his hosting of a private dinner for the leading investors in his personal memecoin, many of whom were foreign nationals and went unidentified to the public. The one-time crypto skeptic has sold multiple rounds of non-fungible tokens (NFTs); his media company announced this year it was raising $2.5 billion to build a bitcoin treasury; and son Eric has been helping run a new bitcoin mining venture . There are few corners of the industry the president doesn\\'t have close connections to. Read More: Trump\\'s Empire Pulled In $57M From Family-Linked Crypto Firm Last Year, Filing Shows',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Peter Schiff, vocal proponent of gold and a longtime critic of cryptocurrencies and bitcoin BTC, said he intends to launch his own gold-backed token while taking a dig at the value of U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. “I get bitcoin, but not U.S. dollar stablecoins,” Schiff posted Friday on X. “If you\\'re going to introduce a third-party custodian, why settle for a token backed by a flawed fiat currency like the dollar, when you can own one backed by gold?\" In a reply to a user who encouraged him to launch a gold-backed stablecoin, Schiff confirmed: \"They already exist. But I do intent [sic] to launch my own.\" His remarks come as the U.S. Senate passed the so-called GENIUS Act to regulate the rapidly growing stablecoin sector, a type of digital currency with prices anchored to an external asset such as fiat currencies. The stablecoin market mushroomed to over $260 billion, with Citi forecasting that it could become a $3.7 trillion asset class by the end of the decade. These tokens have become a key piece of trading infrastructure and are increasingly popular for cross-border payments and remittances. The market is dominated by U.S. dollar-backed tokens like Tether\\'s USDT and Circle\\'s USDC. Gold-backed tokens, meanwhile, make up a niche but growing segment with a market size of around $2 billion. Contrary to fiat-backed stablecoins, gold tokens are mostly used as a store of value, like their physical version, but on blockchain rails. However, there are ongoing efforts to bring more utility for gold tokens in decentralized finance applications, for example using as collateral for loans.

       "  'BODY': 'Semler Scientific (SMLR) has hired Joe Burnett to the newly created position of director of Bitcoin strategy. Alongside, the company — which currently holds 4,449 bitcoin worth about $462 million — announced a goal of owning at least 10,000 bitcoin by the end of this year, 42,000 by year-end 2026 and 105,000 by year-end 2027. \"We are excited to have Joe join our Bitcoin strategy team and help drive our three-year-plan to own 105,000 Bitcoins,\" said company Chairman Eric Semler in a press release . \"Joe is an analytical thought leader on Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies. His expertise will be instrumental as we pursue our Bitcoin treasury strategy and aim to deliver long-term value to our stockholders.\" \"For over seven years, [Joe] has publicly been making the case for Bitcoin as the world\\'s most advanced form of monetary technology,\" the release continued. \"He previously served as director of market research at Unchained, a Bitcoin-focused financial services company.\" Investors, for now, are applauding the news, sending SMLR higher by 14% on Friday even as bitcoin has dipped back below $104,000 and most BTC-related stocks are trading in the red. Prior to today, though, it\\'s been a rough ride for SMLR, which remains lower by 33% year-to-date and more than 50% off its 2025 high above $80. The sharp share price decline has left the company\\'s market capitalization at or below the value of the bitcoin on its balance sheet — thus taking off the table the ability to accretively raise money for more BTC purchases through common share sales. The hiring of Burnett and lofty BTC acquisition goals suggests Semler is likely to get creative with capital raising plans, perhaps — in similar fashion to Michael Saylor\\'s Strategy — turning to the preferred share market.',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'XRP is stabilizing near the top of its recent range and showing signs of bullish pressure as volatility narrows. With strong volume-backed support at $2.14–$2.15 and multiple resistance tests at $2.18, the asset appears to be coiling within an ascending channel, setting the stage for a possible breakout. News Background Middle East conflicts triggered renewed risk-off sentiment across markets, sparking liquidations across crypto. While top assets like Cardano and Solana posted over 1% declines, XRP has managed to hold ground — forming higher lows and carving out a new trading band in the $2.14–$2.18 zone. This resilience comes as the Federal Reserve prepares to announce its next interest rate decision. With global economic policy increasingly fragmented, crypto traders are bracing for sharp moves across digital assets. Despite broader caution, XRP’s recent behavior suggests underlying strength, with technical compression pointing to a potential breakout setup. XRP’s long-term structure remains in focus. After nearly 200 days of ranging between $1.90 and $2.90, the token is testing the upper end of a descending channel on the USDT pair, with macro resistance near $2.60. Analysts continue to debate whether this structure mirrors XRP’s 2017 price setup — a consolidation that preceded a 1,300% breakout. Meanwhile, investor behavior is shifting. Glassnode data shows rising profit-taking activity averaging $68.8 million daily, even as Bollinger Bands narrow — a classic sign of pending volatility. Price Action XRP traded within a 3.81% range from $2.143 to $2.182 over 24 hours, with strong buying pressure defending support at $2.143 during the 07:00 hour, where volume spiked to nearly 50 million units. Resistance was tested repeatedly at $2.179–$2.182 throughout the day but held firm. In the final trading hour, XRP fell from a local high of $2.181 to $2.167, a 0.7% drop that formed a new short-term descending channel. Volume surged to 1.7 million as support at $2.170 was breached, but price stabilized quickly and formed a higher low, preserving the broader uptrend structure. Technical Analysis Recap XRP posted a 3.81% 24-hour range, from $2.143 to $2.182. Support held at $2.143–$2.147 with heavy volume during early session lows. Resistance tested at $2.179–$2.182 multiple times, forming a clear upper boundary. Price action appears to form an ascending channel with higher lows intact. Late-session sell-off triggered by 1.7M volume spike at $2.170, but price recovered to $2.167. Descending micro-channel formed in the final hour; broader trend remains bullish if $2.14 support holds. Bollinger Bands tightening; RSI neutral at 52 suggests pending volatility.',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'North Korean hacking groups have been targeting crypto for years. The 2022 $625 million Ronin bridge exploit was an early wake-up call—but the threat has only evolved. In 2025 alone, North Korean-affiliated attackers have been linked to a string of campaigns designed to siphon value and compromise key players in Web3: They’ve targeted $1.5 billion worth of assets at Bybit through credential-harvesting campaigns, with millions already laundered. They’ve launched malware attacks on MetaMask and Trust Wallet users, attempted to infiltrate exchanges through fake job applicants , and set up shell companies inside the U.S. to target crypto developers . And while the headlines often focus on large-scale thefts, the reality is simpler—and more damning. The weakest layer of Web3 is not smart contracts, but humans. Nation-state attackers no longer need to find zero-days in Solidity. They target the operational vulnerabilities of decentralized teams: poor key management, nonexistent onboarding processes, unvetted contributors pushing code from personal laptops, and treasury governance conducted via Discord polls. For all our industry’s talk of resilience and censorship resistance, many protocols remain soft targets for serious adversaries. At Oak Security, where we’ve conducted over 600 audits across major ecosystems, we consistently see this gap: teams invest heavily in smart contract audits but ignore basic operational security (OPSEC). The result is predictable. Inadequate security processes lead to compromised contributor accounts, governance capture, and preventable losses. The Smart Contract Illusion: Secure Code, Insecure Teams For all the money and talent poured into smart contract security, most DeFi projects still fail the basics of operational security. The assumption seems to be that if the code has passed an audit, the protocol is safe. That belief is not just naive—it\\'s dangerous. The reality is that smart contract exploits are no longer the preferred method of attack. It’s easier—and often more effective—to go after the people running the system. Many DeFi teams have no dedicated security leads, opting to manage enormous treasuries without anyone formally accountable for OPSEC. That alone should be cause for concern. Crucially, OPSEC failures aren’t limited to attacks from state-sponsored groups. In May 2025, Coinbase disclosed that an overseas support agent—bribed by cybercriminals—illegally accessed customer data, triggering a $180–$400 million remediation and ransom limbo. Malicious actors made similar attempts on Binance and Kraken. These incidents weren’t driven by coding errors—they were borne from insider bribery and frontline human failures. The vulnerabilities are systemic. Across the industry, contributors are commonly onboarded via Discord or Telegram, with no identity checks, no structured provisioning, and no verifiably secure devices. Code changes are often pushed from unvetted laptops, with little to no endpoint security or key management in place. Sensitive governance discussions unfold in unsecured tools like Google Docs and Notion, without audit trails, encryption, or proper access controls. And when something inevitably goes wrong, most teams have no response plan, no designated incident commander, and no structured communication protocol—just chaos. This isn’t decentralization. It’s operational negligence. There are DAOs managing $500 million that would fail a basic OPSEC audit. There are treasuries guarded by governance forums, Discord polls, and weekend multisigs – open invitations for bad actors. Until security is treated as a full-stack responsibility—from key management to contributor onboarding—Web3 will keep leaking value through its softest layers. What DeFi Can Learn from TradFi Security Culture TradFi institutions are frequent targets of attacks from North Korean hackers and beyond — and as a result, banks and payment companies lose millions each year. But it’s rare to see a traditional financial institution collapse, or even pause operations, in the face of a cyberattack. These organizations operate on the assumption that attacks are inevitable. They design layered defenses that reduce the likelihood of attacks and minimize damage when exploits do occur, driven by a culture of constant vigilance that DeFi still largely lacks. In a bank, employees do not access trading systems from personal laptops. Devices are hardened and continuously monitored. Access controls and segregation of duties ensure that no single employee can unilaterally move funds or deploy production code. Onboarding and offboarding processes are structured; credentials are issued and revoked with care. And when something goes wrong, incident response is coordinated, practiced, and documented — not improvised in Discord. Web3 needs to adopt similar maturity, but adapted to the realities of decentralized teams. That starts with enforcing OPSEC playbooks from day one, running red-team simulations that test for phishing, infrastructure compromise, and governance capture — not just smart contract audits — and using multi-signature wallets backed by individual hardware wallets or treasury management. Teams should vet contributors and perform background checks on anyone with access to production systems or treasury controls — even in teams that consider themselves fully \\'decentralized.\\' Some projects are starting to lead here, investing in structured security programs and enterprise-grade tooling for key management. Others leverage advanced Security Operations (SecOps) tooling and dedicated security consultants. But these practices remain the exception, not the norm. Decentralization Is No Excuse for Negligence It’s time to confront the real reason many Web3 teams lag on operational security: it is difficult to implement in decentralized, globally distributed organizations. Budgets are tight, contributors are transient, and cultural resistance to cybersecurity principles, which are often misperceived as \"centralization,\" remains strong. But decentralization is no excuse for negligence. Nation-state adversaries understand this ecosystem. They’re already inside the gates. And the global economy is increasingly reliant on on-chain infrastructure. Web3 platforms urgently need to employ and adhere to disciplined cybersecurity practices, or risk becoming a permanent funding stream for hackers and scammers seeking to undermine them. Code alone will not defend us. Culture will.',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Bridge Biotherapeutics (288330), a South Korean biotech company, may be looking to become the country\\'s answer to Strategy (MSTR) or Metaplanet (3350) by adopting a bitcoin treasury strategy. Seongnam-based Bridge has received a 25 billion won ($183.3 million) backing from crypto investment firm Parataxis, with which it will build a BTC treasury. Bridge will change its corporate name to Parataxis Korea and continue to trade on the South Korean stock market KOSDAQ, according to an announcement on Friday . \"Inspired by the growing interest in BTC treasury strategies seen in companies like Strategy in the U.S. and Metaplanet in Japan, we believe institutional interest in this space is increasing globally,\" Parataxis partner Andrew Kim said. More and more companies are copying the playbook of Strategy , which owns more than 2.8% of all the bitcoin that will ever exist. Tokyo-listed hotel operator turned bitcoin investor Metaplanet holds 10,000 BTC ($1.04 billion), making it the largest holding of a public company outside North America. These firms have witnessed dramatic appreciation in their share price as traders cash in on them as a bitcoin-proxy asset. Bridge joins fellow healthcare-adjacent companies Semler Scientific (SMLR) and Prenetics Global (PRE) in adopting a bitcoin treasury strategy. Parataxis is currently preparing to go public in the U.S. via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), SilverBox Corp IV (SBXD). Bridge shares closed over 20.5% higher on Friday at 943 won ($0.69).',\n",

The regulator is proposing allowing crypto exchanges, or a person related to the exchange, to issue utility tokens for blockchain transactions, it said on its website . Exchanges will have to disclose the names of anyone related to token issuers so the SEC can monitor for insider trading. The consultation comes as the regulator looks to strike a balance between allowing innovation while preventing illicit activity. In May it said citizens will be blocked from accessing crypto exchanges including Bybit and OKX from June 28, citing violations of the Digital Asset Business Act. In March it added Tether's USDT stablecoin and Circle's (CRCL) USDC to its list of approved tokens that can be traded on exchanges. Previously, only bitcoin BTC, ether ETH, XRP XRP, stellar XLM and some tokens used in the Bank of Thailand’s settlement system were approved by the SEC. Thailands' SEC will be gathering opinions on its rules up until July 21, it said.\",\n",

       "  'BODY': 'By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Risk assets, cryptocurrencies among them, breathed a sigh of relief after President Donald Trump ruled out an immediate entry into the Israel-Iran war, saying he may wait two more weeks before deciding whether to add U.S. firepower to the conflict. Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering around $106,000, up 0.9% in the past day, and the broader CoinDesk 20 index has gained 0.77%. In traditional markets, oil prices slipped 1.7% after a three-week rally and European stock indexes rose. U.S. equity futures are slightly higher than they were this time Thursday. Trump\\'s comment reduced the odds of U.S. military action before the end of the month on prediction market Polymarket from around 70% to 40% . If the timeline is expanded to next month, the odds are now sitting at 62%, down from 90% on June 17. “While the immediate prospect of a U.S. intervention in Iran may have diminished, the fact this is reportedly a two-week hiatus means it will remain a live issue for the markets going into next week,” AJ Bell investment analyst Dan Coatsworth told Yahoo Finance. Despite the crypto market\\'s relative stability, analysts see diverging risks. Glassnode, a blockchain analytics company, said subdued on-chain activity could reflect a more mature market dominated by institutions making large, infrequent transactions. A new report from CryptoQuant, on the other hand, warns bitcoin could drop to $92,000 or lower, if demand fails to rebound. ETF flows are down 60% since April, whale buying has slowed by half, and short-term holders have dumped 800,000 BTC since late May. Stay alert! What to Watch Crypto June 20: Proof-of-stake blockchain BlackCoin (BLK) activates SegWit on mainnet, improving security and performance. Nodes must be upgraded to release v26.2.0 before this date. Wallets from 13.2 can be used in 26.2.x. June 25: ZIGChain (ZIG) mainnet will go live . June 30: CME Group will introduce spot-quoted futures, pending regulatory approval, allowing trading in bitcoin, ether and major U.S. equity indices with contracts holdable for up to five years.

Exec Kash Dhanda said the current DAO setup breeds mistrust and FUD, preventing the team, holders and platform from working cohesively. A new governance model will be introduced next year, aiming to \"unify rather than divide\" the Jupiter community. Staking rewards (ASR) will continue at 50M JUP per quarter, but no new DAO-funded workgroups or emissions will be created in the meantime. The JUP token has dropped nearly 22% in the past month, and Friday\\'s governance news had minimal impact, with the price hovering near $0.40. Derivatives Positioning Open interest (OI) across top derivatives venues remains stable, but subdued relative to earlier highs. According to Velo data, respective OI sits at $56.73 billion, still well below the $65.95 billion peak seen on June 11. Binance has regained ground with $24.5 billion in OI, though this remains short of its previous $27.9 billion high. BCH stands out as a notable mover, recording the third-largest notional OI gain over the last 24 hours with an $83.4 million increase, following BTC and ETH according to Laevitas. BTC and ETH options positioning remains concentrated around out-of-the-money strikes, despite a minor expiry today. On Deribit, ETH options contract OI reached a yearly high of 2.58 million, with most exposure set to expire on June 27. ETH skew remains heavily call-dominated at the $3,200 strike, while BTC interest is clustered between $100,000 and $110,000. ETH’s put/call ratio stands at 0.43, and BTC’s at 0.63. Notional flows are similarly aligned, with top-traded contracts including 27JUN25 $2,600C and $100,000P, reflecting both directional interest and tail-risk hedging. Funding rate APRs across perpetual swaps remain broadly positive according to Velo data, with BTC and ETH both printing 10.95% on Bybit and Hyperliquid. Binance funding is also elevated at 8.98% for BTC and 10.05% for ETH, while Deribit remains flat. In contrast, BNB shows sharp negative prints (–22.73% on Bybit and –13.04% on Hyperliquid), hinting at short pressure amid falling dominance. Altcoin funding is similarly mixed, with names like AAVE and DOGE staying positive while SOL and AVAX are little changed. Coinglass data shows $131.89 million in 24-hour liquidations, skewed 56% toward shorts. ETH led notional liquidations at $32.2 million, followed by BTC at $28.7 million. Binance heatmaps reveal dense liquidation clusters between $106,000 and $108,000, indicating that recent price action cleared layered short positioning. BTC dominance continues to hover around 65%, and while short liquidations hint at squeezed leverage, directional conviction appears measured heading into the next major expiry window. Market Movements BTC is up 1.63% from 4 p.m. ET Thursday at $106,015.34 (24hrs: +0.98%) ETH is up 1.85% at $2,554.74 (24hrs: +0.46%) CoinDesk 20 is up 1.3% at 3,034.29 (24hrs: +0.76%) Ether CESR Composite Staking Rate is up 7 bps at 3.05% BTC funding rate is at 0.0071% (7.7451% annualized) on OKX DXY is down 0.30% at 98.61 Gold futures are down 0.99% at $3,374.40 Silver futures are down 2.20% at $36.10 Nikkei 225 closed down 0.22% at 38,403.23 Hang Seng closed up 1.26% at 23,530.48 FTSE is up 0.44% at 8,830.90 Euro Stoxx 50 is up 0.80% at 5,238.57 DJIA closed on Wednesday down 0.10% at 42,171.66 S&P 500 closed down 0.03% at 5,980.87 Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.13% at 19,546.27 S&P/TSX Composite closed down 0.20% at 26,506.00 S&P 40 Latin America closed on Thursday down 0.15% at 2,614.38 U.S. 10-Year Treasury rate is up 2 bps at 4.42% E-mini S&P 500 futures are down 0.24% at 5,967.00 E-mini Nasdaq-100 futures are down 0.25% at 21,666.75 E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average Index are down 0.21% at 42,098.00 Bitcoin Stats BTC Dominance: 65% (0.25%) Ethereum to bitcoin ratio: 0.02407 (-0.08%) Hashrate (seven-day moving average): 864 EH/s Hashprice (spot): $53.25 Total Fees: 5.07 BTC / $537,039.75 CME Futures Open Interest: 154,500 BTC BTC priced in gold: 31.3 oz BTC vs gold market cap: 8.87% Technical Analysis Bitcoin reclaimed its monthly open following a successful retest of the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), signaling a potential shift in short-term momentum. The asset is now trading above Monday’s low and appears to be making a move to recapture the full Monday range. If successful, this would open the path toward the Monday high near $109,000. However, the price is currently capped by the 20-day EMA. For bulls to maintain control, it will be crucial for BTC to continue closing above the monthly open. A decisive close above the January highs would further invalidate the prevailing weekly swing failure pattern, reinforcing the bullish case and potentially paving the way for a broader continuation to the upside.

       "  'BODY': 'Arizona moved closer to establishing a bitcoin BTC reserve fund after the state\\'s Senate voted in favor of the bill at its third reading. Arizona\\'s Senate passed House Bill 2324 (HB2324) in a 16-14 vote on Thursday, sending it back to House for a final decision. The legislation would update Arizona\\'s laws on forfeiture, allowing the state to hold abandoned digital assets as unclaimed property. It also creates a \"Bitcoin and digital assets reserve fund\" to manage the forfeited assets. It follows House Bill 2749 (HB2749) , enacted in April, which amended unclaimed property frameworks to integrate digital assets. The bill is distinct from Senate Bill 1025 (SB1025) , which proposed using seized funds to invest in BTC. That passed the House 31-25 before being vetoed by Governor Katie Hobbs, who referred to cryptocurrency as an \"untested investment.\" The only state to have completed the legislative process for creating a BTC reserve is New Hampshire . Like Arizona, a bill in Texas is also in its final stages .',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'XRP XRP has staged one of the strongest rallies among crypto majors this cycle, but early retail holders are heading for the exit under the surface. Now trading above $2 — more than thrice its pre-rally base from October 2024 — XRP has become one of the best-performing large-cap tokens over the past 8 months. Investors who bought below 60 cents are sitting on gains upward of 300%, prompting a sharp pickup in profit-taking. According to on-chain data from Glassnode, the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of realized profits from XRP wallets hit $68.8 million earlier this month, the highest in over a year. That’s a clear sign of distribution pressure, with early accumulators cashing out into strength as the token tests key resistance levels just below its 2021 peak. That profit-taking pressure may help explain XRP’s failure to break above $2.20 in recent sessions, despite multiple bullish headlines and technical tailwinds. Read more: XRP Drops 5% as High-Volume Selling Pressure Dominates Market While the broader setup remains positive, supported by regulatory clarity in the U.S. and Ripple’s growing push into tokenized asset infrastructure, the near-term price action reflects a supply overhang from long-term holders. A recent CryptoQuant analysis showed that the 1-year cumulative buy/sell quote volume difference for altcoins (excluding BTC and ETH) — a proxy for net investor flows — currently stands at negative $36 billion. That’s a sharp reversal from December 2024, when the metric briefly flipped positive, marking a local top for altcoins. Since then, it’s been a one-way bleed, with “altcoin investors MIA,” CryptoQuant independent analyst Burak Kesmeci said in a Thursday post . Despite pockets of strength in XRP, SOL, and a few narrative tokens tied to real-world assets (RWAs), the broader altcoin ecosystem remains stuck in a bear market, he noted. Unless risk appetite returns or capital flows back into Layer 1s, DeFi, and gaming, hopes of an “altseason” may continue to fade into the summer.

       "  'BODY': 'Crypto markets drifted lower on Thursday, caught between hawkish macro guidance, looming global trade deadlines, and fading volatility. Bitcoin BTC hovered near $104,700 during Asia hours, slipping 1.2% over 24 hours, while ether ETH traded just below $2,860, down 1.8% on the day. The soft price action tracks with broader macro unease following Wednesday’s FOMC hold, where the Fed kept rates unchanged but reiterated a cautious, inflation-sensitive stance. Seasonality is starting to show Historically subdued during the June-July stretch, crypto markets have entered a lull with BTC front-end implied volumes slipping under 40%, erasing the risk premium from recent geopolitical tension, Singapore-based QCP Capital noted in a Thursday market broadcast. Open interest across BTC and ETH perps remains flat, and option markets skew negative, with puts trading at a premium to calls – a sign of traders hedging against short-term pullbacks. “There’s been no change to the technical picture, which remains supportive of another push to the topside,” said Joel Kruger, strategist at LMAX Group, in an email to CoinDesk. “BTC continues to consolidate bullishly, and a move through recent highs could set up a run toward $145,000.” Ether still lags its 2021 highs but is gaining momentum, he added. “Clearing $2,900 could bring $3,400 into play,” Kruger said. One bright spot for crypto is the U.S. Senate’s passage of a stablecoin framework, which adds another building block to what is becoming a more regulatory-friendly global environment. That’s reinforced a broader institutional conviction. “Globally, we’re seeing continued progress that promises greater clarity and a more welcoming environment for institutional crypto adoption,” Kruger added. Still, the near-term setup remains cautious. Month-end OPEX flows, systematic rebalancing, and a lack of fresh catalysts could keep BTC stuck in its $ 102,000–$ 108,000 band for now. But with H2 historically strong for crypto, some desks are already looking ahead. “The worst may be behind us,” Kruger said. “And the next leg up could catch many off guard.”',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Good Morning, Asia. Here\\'s what\\'s making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk\\'s Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its trading day, bitcoin BTC is trading above $104,500 and, despite a possible looming war in the Middle East, has been relatively flat on the day with negligible market movement. Indeed, for the last full week, BTC is only down 2%, according to CoinDesk market data . Analysts are debating whether the crypto market’s current stillness is a sign of strength or if something more precarious is afoot. Three new reports this week from CryptoQuant , Glassnode , and trading firm Flowdesk all point to the same surface conditions: low volatility, tight price action, and subdued on-chain activity. Additionally, retail participation has waned, and institutional players, from ETFs to whales, are now shaping the structure of flows. But it’s CryptoQuant that’s flashing the most urgent warning. In its June 19 report, CryptoQuant argued that BTC could soon revisit $92,000 support or even fall as low as $81,000 if demand continues to deteriorate. Spot demand is still increasing, but well below trend. ETF flows have dropped by more than 60% since April, while whale accumulation has halved. Short-term holders, who are usually newer market participants, have shed approximately 800,000 BTC since late May. Their demand momentum indicator, which tracks directional buying strength across key cohorts, is now reading negative 2 million BTC, the lowest in CryptoQuant’s dataset. Glassnode , however, sees the same signals and arrives at a far less dire conclusion. In its weekly on-chain update, the firm acknowledges that the Bitcoin blockchain is “quiet,\" meaning transaction counts are down, fees are minimal, and miner revenue is subdued. However, this suggests that it may not be a weakness, but rather a reflection of the network’s evolution. On-chain settlement volume remains high, but it’s concentrated in large-value transfers, suggesting the chain is increasingly being used by institutions and whales. The derivatives market, Glassnode notes, now dwarfs on-chain activity, with futures and options volumes regularly exceeding spot by 7x–16x. That shift has brought more sophisticated hedging, better collateral practices, and a more mature, if less frenetic, market structure. France-based Flowdesk, a market maker and trading firm, has views that fall somewhere in between. While noting thinning altcoin flows and flat market-making volumes, its June 19 update describes the market as “coiled,” not cracking. Flowdesk highlights a surge in tokenized assets, such as Gold-backed XAUT (up 56% in volume), stablecoin growth, and increasing RWA activity. To them, low volatility may simply be the calm before a directional breakout, which is not necessarily downwards. But in the end, no one seems to hold a reliable map for what’s ahead. Even Polymarket bettors aren\\'t sure as there is a near equal chance of BTC dropping to $90K in June or moving up to $115K-120K. One thing is for sure: the tug-of-war between bullish institutional activities and waning retail demand potentially opens bitcoin up to dramatic moves on either side of the trade, which will likely dictate the market’s next chapter. Presto Research Says Crypto Treasury Companies Have Less Risk Than You Think A new report from Presto Research argues that Crypto Treasury Companies (CTCs), such as Strategy and Metaplanet, are not just leveraged bitcoin ETFs, but a new form of financial engineering with less risk than many investors assume. Strategy’s latest raise, which raised nearly $1 billion via perpetual preferred shares , shows how BTC’s volatility can be used to an issuer’s advantage. These securities, along with convertible bonds and at-the-market equity sales, allow CTCs to fund aggressive crypto accumulation without triggering margin risk. Presto points out that Strategy’s BTC is unpledged and Metaplanet’s bonds are unsecured, meaning collateral liquidation, the primary trigger in past crypto blowups like Celsius and Three Arrows, is largely absent here. That does not eliminate risk, but it changes the nature of it. The real challenge, Presto argues, is not crypto exposure itself but the discipline to manage dilution, cash flow, and capital timing. Metaplanet’s “bitcoin yield” metric, which measures BTC per fully diluted share, reflects that focus on shareholder value. As long as CTCs can manage the financial mechanics behind their accumulation strategies, they will earn NAV premiums just like high-growth companies in traditional markets. But if they miscalculate, the same tools that fuel their rise could accelerate their fall. Semler Scientific Maps Bold Plan to Hold 105,000 BTC by 2027 Semler Scientific (Nasdaq: SMLR) has unveiled one of the most aggressive bitcoin accumulation roadmaps in corporate history, announcing plans to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, 42,000 by 2026, and a staggering 105,000 by the close of 2027. The California-based medical device maker, which pivoted to a bitcoin treasury strategy last year, is effectively trying to increase its current bitcoin stash of 4,449 coins by more than two fold over the next 30 months. It plans to do so using a mix of equity raises, debt financing, and operational cash flow. There aren\\'t specific details of how the company plans to fund the buy. Hwever, historically Semler’s primary mechanism for acquiring bitcoin was selling new shares under its at-the-market (ATM) program, which relies on the company trading at a premium to its net asset value (NAV). According to data from Strategy-Tracker , Semler’s mNAV currently sits at 0.859x, meaning the market values the firm’s equity lower than its BTC holdings, which could be cutting off its ability to raise accretive capital. How this dynamic plays out, would be worth watching as the firm initiates more bitcoin buying. Even as bitcoin has surged to all-time highs above $100,000, Semler shares are down nearly 40% on the year. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin remains stuck below $105K despite strong ETF inflows, with repeated resistance at $105,150 and signs of institutional accumulation offset by short-term bearish momentum and macro volatility. ETH: Ethereum found support at $2,490 after a high-volume selloff broke key levels, with the price consolidating in a tight range amid geopolitical tensions and macro uncertainty, signaling potential for a breakout if resistance at $2,510 is cleared. Gold: Gold hovered near $3,366 on Thursday, little changed as escalating geopolitical tensions offset pressure from the Fed’s hawkish stance, while platinum retreated after hitting a near 10-year high; U.S. markets remained closed for Juneteenth. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 opened 0.24% higher Friday as Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose ahead of China’s loan prime rate decision and amid ongoing Israel-Iran tensions.

       "  'BODY': \"XRP is tightening its trading range near $2.15, signaling a potential breakout as majors remain rooted to the whims of macroeconomic tensions. The token's current price action reflects an extended accumulation phase, with technical indicators showing decreasing volatility and firm support around the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. News Background XRP’s recent stability comes as broader economic forces loom large. Escalating trade tensions between major economies and diverging central bank policies continue to pressure risk assets, creating headwinds for crypto investors. Despite this, XRP has maintained a steady price floor following its explosive January rally to $3.39. Ripple’s legal standoff with the U.S. SEC remains a key wildcard. Settlement talks are reportedly ongoing, and speculation continues to build around a potential XRP spot ETF, with Franklin Templeton's application delayed but still under consideration. Meanwhile, Ripple’s leadership claims that XRP could capture up to 14% of SWIFT’s transaction volume — a massive leap in institutional use case. The crypto market’s cautious tone has not dampened interest in Ripple’s cross-border payment infrastructure. And with technical compression now peaking, traders are watching closely for signs of a confirmed breakout or breakdown. Price Action XRP traded within a narrow 24-hour range from $2.135 to $2.186, showing signs of a market coiling for a move. A bullish burst between 13:21 and 13:30 pushed prices from $2.151 to $2.158 on high volume, suggesting growing buyer interest. The price briefly pulled back to $2.150 in the 13:47–13:48 window — a critical zone that aligns with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement from January’s high. Technical Analysis Recap XRP posted a 2.38% trading range over 24 hours, from $2.135 to $2.186. Support held at $2.133 with above-average volume; resistance formed near $2.186. Current trading band between $2.150–$2.165 shows narrowing volatility — a classic pre-breakout structure. Fibonacci support at $2.152 (38.2% retracement) remains intact. Volume spike confirmed local high at $2.158 during 13:21–13:30. Sharp dip to $2.150 tested key support; quick recovery to $2.152 shows buying strength. RSI and MACD trending flat, indicating a potential breakout setup once volume returns.

The platform, formerly known as Twitter, will \"soon\" allow users to make investments or trades on the platform, CEO Linda Yaccarino told the newspaper in an interview at the Cannes Lions advertising festival. \"Soon you\\'re going to be able to live your whole financial life on the platform,\" Yaccarino said in a panel appearance at the same event , listing peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, storing value, paying creators or watching pay-per-view (PPV) events as examples. X partnered with Visa to develop \"X Money\" earlier this year as a digital wallet and P2P-payment service. This forms part of Musk\\'s ambition to turn X into a super app, akin to the Chinese WeChat, which offers numerous retail and financial services as well as messaging. Elon Musk has become closely associated with cryptocurrency over a number of years, due to his fondness for memecoin DOGE and the 11,500 BTC ($1.2 billion) that his electric-car manufacturer Tesla holds . As such, crypto observers will think it likely that any plans Musk has for X to provide financial services will involve cryptocurrency in some form. X did not immediately respond to CoinDesk\\'s request for comment.',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'In today’s Crypto for Advisors, Bryan Courchesne from DAIM provides information on tax planning for crypto trades. Although we are half a year away from tax season, there are many considerations to track in order to be tax-ready. Then, Saim Akif from Akif CPA breaks down the differences in tax treatment between crypto and equities/bonds in Ask an Expert. Unknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Crypto Taxes Are Complicated, Don’t Let Them Derail Your Portfolio As advisors focused on crypto, we’re familiar with the unique tax situations this asset class presents. For example, crypto is not subject to wash-sale rules, which allows for more efficient tax-loss harvesting. It also enables direct asset swaps, such as converting bitcoin (BTC) to ether (ETH) or ETH to Solana (SOL), without first selling into cash. These are just a couple of features that set crypto apart from traditional investments. However, perhaps the most important thing for investors to consider is the sheer number of platforms they may use and how challenging it can be to track everything at tax time. Tracking your crypto taxes isn’t just a year-end chore; it’s a year-round challenge, especially if you’re active on multiple centralized exchanges (CEXs) or decentralized platforms (DEXs). Every trade, swap, airdrop, staking reward, or bridging event can be a taxable event. Centralized Exchange Trading When using CEXs like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken, you may receive year-end tax summaries, but those are often incomplete or inconsistent across platforms. One major challenge is tracking your cost basis across exchanges. For example, if you buy Amazon stock in a Fidelity account and transfer it to Schwab, your cost basis transfers seamlessly and updates with each new trade. At tax time, Schwab can generate an accurate 1099 showing your gains and losses. But in crypto, if you transfer assets from Kraken to Coinbase, your cost basis doesn’t automatically transfer with them. If you’re moving assets across multiple platforms, you’ll need to manually track every transaction, or you’ll face a major headache when filing taxes. Decentralized Exchange Trading Things get even more complicated when using DEXs. Apps like Coinbase Wallet (not to be confused with the Coinbase exchange) or Phantom connect you to decentralized trading platforms like Uniswap or Jupiter. These DEXs don’t issue tax forms or track your cost basis, so it’s entirely up to you to log and reconcile every transaction. Miss a single token swap or forget to record the fair market value of a liquidity pool withdrawal, and your tax report could be inaccurate. That could trigger IRS scrutiny or lead to missed deductions. While some apps can calculate gains and losses from a single wallet address, they often struggle when assets are transferred between addresses, making them less useful for active users. And here’s the kicker: if you’re actively trading on DEXs, chances are you’re not even making money. But even losses must be reported correctly to qualify for a deduction. If not, you risk losing the write-off or, worse, facing an audit. Unless you’re a full-time crypto trader, the time and effort required to track every transaction isn’t just stressful, it can cost you real money. What steps can I take to make sure I\\'m tax ready? There are, however, several ways to prepare properly for crypto taxes: Use crypto tax software from the beginning. Even then, you’ll want to double-check that the reported activity makes sense and adjust as needed. Hire a crypto tax specialist or work with a crypto-focused advisor who understands the landscape. Download all transaction logs and see if your CPA or advisor can help build a cost basis and determine your realized gains and losses. As adoption increases, tax reporting will undoubtedly evolve — in the meantime keeping track of your trade activity is important to be ready for tax season. - Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM Unknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Ask an Expert Q. Why are advisors watching crypto closely? A. Institutional crypto inflows have surged to $35 billion . While crypto is more volatile than traditional assets, major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, have historically outperformed other traditional asset classes since 2012. Q. How is crypto being treated differently from equities/bonds from a tax side? A. Crypto differs fundamentally from equities and bonds. Advisors must track each wallet separately for cost basis (starting Jan 2025). Unlike traditional 1099s, clients often get little to no reporting support from exchanges, especially for self-custodied assets. Q. Do you have any special insights for CPAs and tax advisors? A. Compliance isn’t optional anymore. Starting with 2025 returns: Wallet-level cost basis reporting is mandatory. IRS Form 1099-DA will begin showing up in 2026. Exchanges often don’t support reporting for self-custodied assets. Smart tax professionals are combining tax reporting, audit defence, and DeFi accounting into premium advisory services. - Saim Akif, founder, Akif CPA Unknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Keep Reading Spanish banking giant BBVA tells wealthy clients to invest 3 to 7% of their portfolio in bitcoin .

       "  'BODY': 'Crypto exchange Kraken has launched bitcoin BTC staking through a new integration with Babylon, as decentralized finance on BTC picks up. Babylon is a Bitcoin-native protocol that enables BTC to secure proof-of-stake (PoS) networks without leaving the blockchain. The service allows Kraken users to stake their bitcoin directly, locking it in a custodial vault on the native chain. The staked bitcoin is then delegated to PoS networks via Babylon, and rewards are paid in BABY, the token of Babylon Genesis, a bitcoin-secured Layer 1 , Kraken said. Bitcoin has historically been used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. The advent of novel security sharing protocols has made BTC staking a third native use case , bitcoin DeFi, for the world\\'s largest cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin network is \"evolving into a broader decentralized finance ecosystem with the emergence of Bitcoin DeFi,\" Binance Research said in a report in March. Only ~0.8% of the bitcoin supply is currently being used in DeFi, and this presents a large \"untapped opportunity,\" the report said. Binance, the competing crypto exchange of Kraken, also offers a bitcoin staking opportunity on its platform through Babylon . “With this launch, clients can earn a return on their BTC while also enabling emerging PoS blockchains to benefit from the economic weight of bitcoin in order to validate transactions and bolster the security of their networks,” said Kraken’s Global Head of Consumer, Mark Greenberg, in the release. The mechanism is fully on-chain, with staking governed by Bitcoin scripts and cryptographic safeguards to deter malicious behavior. Users can unstake at any time, with around a 7-day unbonding period. The crypto exchange first introduced custodial staking in 2019. The bitcoin staking feature is now available across all Kraken platforms. Read more: Kraken Unveils White-Glove Prime Brokerage Service for Crypto Institutions',\n",

       "  'BODY': 'Project Eleven has raised $6 million to protect bitcoin BTC from the existential threat of quantum computing, as fears mount that the network’s core cryptography could one day be rendered obsolete. The round was co-led by Variant Fund and Quantonation, with participation from Castle Island Ventures alongside founding investors Nebular and Formation, according to a release. \"As quantum computing capabilities advance, the threat to systems like Bitcoin is no longer theoretical, it\\'s imminent,\" Alex Pruden, CEO of Project Eleven, said in a release. \"This funding allows us to stay ahead of that curve, building the tools, standards, and ecosystem required to ensure digital assets remain secure in a post-quantum world,” Pruden said. Earlier this year, Project Eleven launched the Q-Day Prize, offering 1 BTC to the first team that can break Bitcoin’s elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) using a quantum computer. “We define Q-Day as the moment when quantum computers become capable of breaking the elliptic-curve cryptography that secures private keys used by Bitcoin,” said Conor Deegan, co-founder and VP of Engineering at Project Eleven in a release. Project Eleven also announced it is launching Yellowpages a post-quantum cryptographic registry where users can generate hybrid key pairs, create proofs linking them to their existing BTC addresses, and timestamp those proofs on a verifiable ledger. Yellowpages works by having users generate a new key pair using post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, such as lattice-based systems, that are resistant to the types of attacks a future quantum computer could launch. They then create a cryptographic proof linking this quantum-safe key to their existing BTC address. That proof is timestamped and stored in Yellowpages, a public registry hosted off-chain. It doesn’t move funds or alter anything on the Bitcoin blockchain, but creates a verifiable paper trail of wallet ownership that could serve as a fallback if elliptic curve cryptography is ever broken. “Preparing ahead of Q-Day means ensuring that digital assets remain secure and verifiable in a post-quantum world. With Yellowpages, we’re giving users free, audited, and open-source tools to proactively establish quantum-resilient ownership today,” Deegan continued. Securing BTC against quantum through consensus The approach contrasts with solutions like QRAMP , a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal that mandates a hard-fork migration to quantum-safe addresses. While effective in theory, QRAMP and similar proposals face a high barrier to adoption because they would require consensus, a tall order in a governance environment known for caution. Ethereum’s multi-year journey to Proof-of-Stake and Bitcoin’s recent OP_RETURN debate are reminders of just how slow protocol change can be, and some analysts have warned that the slow governance process is a threat itself. This route would bypass the need for consensus, while also facilitating the mass adoption of quantum defenses. As Rick Maeda of Presto Research recently warned in an interview with CoinDesk , quantum defenses must be built linearly, not reactively, because by the time the threat is real, it’s already too late. Project Eleven’s latest moves suggest some in the crypto industry are taking this threat seriously while acknowledging the weakness of current methods.',\n",

The company filed a 40-F form, according to a filing on Wednesday. The 40-F form is required from Canadian companies wishing to offer securities in the U.S. If the company gets approved by the SEC it will operate under the ticker STKE, it said. Getting approved by the SEC would grant the company access to Nasdaq, the world's second largest stock exchange . Shares of SOL Strategies closed over 4% higher on Wednesday at Canadian dollar $2.38. SOL Strategies has been ramping up its SOL investment. In May, it acquired 122,524 SOL for $18.25 million.

       "  'BODY': 'The pro-Israel hacker collective Gonjeshke Darande released the full source code of Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex, just a day after orchestrating a $100 million exploit across multiple blockchains as the war between the two countries nears the end of its first week. The move raised fresh concerns for users who have not yet withdrawn their assets from the platform because the code makes it extremely easy for nefarious actors to access and exploit. Israel attacked military and nuclear sites in Iran on Friday saying it had to take action to prevent its enemy, which has vowed to wipe the Jewish state off the map, attaining nuclear weapons. Iran responded with ballistic missile launches targeting the entire country, sending millions into shelters at short notice. In an X post on Thursday, the hacker group, whose name is Farsi for Predatory Sparrow, wrote: “Time’s up – full source code linked below. ASSETS LEFT IN NOBITEX ARE NOW ENTIRELY OUT IN THE OPEN.” The leak included blockchain scripts, internal privacy settings and a list of servers, effectively dismantling the exchange’s back-end security. The source code dump follows through on threats issued a day earlier, when Gonjeshke Darande claimed responsibility for the hack and promised to release internal data. The group accused Nobitex of aiding Iran in circumventing international sanctions and called the platform the “regime’s favorite sanctions violation tool.” Over $90 million in tokens from Bitcoin, EVM, Ripple, Dogecoin, Solana and other networks were deliberately sent to burner addresses, making recovery unlikely. Blockchain data shows that funds were moved to provocatively named wallets, such as “1FuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXaAovLX” and “DFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXWLW65t,” suggesting the use of brute-force-generated vanity addresses that the attackers do not hold private keys for. The IRCG, or Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , is an powerful and influential branch of the Iranian military. Nobitex responded on Thursday, stating that no additional losses occurred after the leak and that it plans to begin restoring services within five days, although ongoing internet disruptions in Iran may delay the recovery.',\n",

The return to zero comes as tariffs threaten to deflate nations with trade surplus, such as Switzerland and China. The latest rate cut is bank’s sixth straight move since it started reducing borrowing costs in March 2024.

       "  'BODY': 'Crypto majors slid further on Thursday and the dollar gained ground as fears of a broader conflict in the Middle East intensified. XRP XRP, Cardano’s ADA ADA, and Solana’s SOL SOL lost over 1% in the past 24 hours, while dogecoin DOGE is flat on the day but down over 10% for the week, wiping out its early June rally. Ether ETH lost 0.7%, reversing all gains from earlier in the week. As such, spot bitcoin BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. continued to attract inflows, with over $389 million in fresh buys on Wednesday, data shows . Spot ETH ETFs racked up $19 million in positive flows. U.S. officials are reportedly weighing a direct strike on Iran, while the Federal Reserve flagged a more persistent inflation outlook, spooking investors and pushing equities, crypto majors, and commodities into choppy waters. Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned on Wednesday that tariffs and global conflict could make it harder to tame inflation. While the central bank held rates steady, Powell said the cost of tariffs “will fall on the end consumer,” and that the Fed needs to “see more” before cutting. Altcoins, considered higher-risk bets, are typically the first to get dumped in times of macro stress. Bitcoin continues to remains rangebound. While the largest cryptocurrency has climbed 13% year-to-date, buoyed by ETF inflows and dollar weakness, it hasn’t acted decisively as either a safe haven or a risk asset this week. “Bitcoin seems stuck between two worlds,” said FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich. “It’s not reacting to rising risk appetite, nor surging like gold during heightened conflict.”',\n",

       "  'SOURCE_ID': 5,\n",
       "  'BODY': 'Bitcoin\\'s BTC bull market has stalled, and how. Despite a surge in spot ETF inflows , stablecoin market caps, and positive regulatory developments in the U.S., the leading cryptocurrency by market value continues to trade directionless, fluctuating between $100,000 and $110,000. It\\'s been a record 42 straight days of back-and-forth trading above the $100K mark, and the question is: Who has been selling BTC and quietly counteracting the ETF inflows amid mounting concerns about the U.S. fiscal situation ? According to Alexander Blume, CEO at the SEC-registered investment adviser Two Prime, BTC is facing a unique crosswind of participant composition as it transitions from speculative buyers to long-term investors. \"Amidst the recent geopolitical turmoil, it makes sense that speculators and leverage traders are taking risk off the table. At the same time, new long-term investors are buying the dip,\" Blume told CoinDesk. \"It seems about right that we are currently at an equilibrium of these groups.\" Blockchain data tracked by Glassnode shows that wallets with a history of holding coins for less than a year have recently increased their profit-taking. On Monday, these wallets accounted for 83% of the total realized profit. Furthermore, wallets holding coins for six to 12 months alone contributed $904 million to the selling pressure in the market, the second-highest year-to-date total. The selling by short-term holders follows an even more aggressive profit-taking operation by long-term holders in May and early this month. According to Glassnode, the realized profit of wallets holding coins for over 12 months reached a peak of $1.2 billion last week. Last week, this cohort realized just $324 million in profits. \"Long-term OG investors continue to sell into the steady ETF-driven demand, effectively absorbing inflows and keeping price action in check. This dynamic has led to a compression in volatility, but a breakout is inevitable,\" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research , said in a note to clients Thursday. Miners offload BTC Miners, or those producing bitcoin, have also been contributing to the selling pressure, according to data source IntoTheBlock . The balance held in miner wallets has declined to roughly 1.91 million BTC from 1.94 million at the end of May, indicating that these entities offloaded approximately 30,000 BTC in 20 days. \"Miners have to continually sell, and believe it or not, some long-term holders continue to sell gradually as they manage their USD liabilities. The key thing is volume - is it sold or bought on high volume? It is noise and speculative flows that can revert very quickly,\" Philippe Bekhazi, CEO of crypto platform XBTO, told CoinDesk. Note that miners\\' share in total spot market volume is minuscule and has hit the lowest since 2022. Accumulation stalls for next-best alternatives Overall, the substantial accumulation by both whales and small addresses observed during bitcoin\\'s initial run higher from the early April lows near $75,000 has stalled since prices broke into six figures. \"Those same accumulation patterns began to weaken once BTC breached $100k. The reason the price slowed down is likely due to the availability of next-best alternatives. Funding rates were rallying hard, and having delta-neutral positions earning 15-30% APY likely seemed attractive enough to de-risk on a directional basis,\" Ben Lilly, co-founder of Jlabs Digital and Deploy.finance, noted. The delta-neutral trades involve shorting perpetual futures and simultaneously purchasing the asset in the spot market when futures trade at a premium to the spot price. The non-directional arbitrage strategy enables traders to capitalize on price differentials while mitigating risks associated with price volatility. Jimmy Yang, co-founder of Orbit Markets, said that bitcoin maturing into a more stable asset class means it may not necessarily generate outsized returns. That has likely prompted some holders to divest into other assets. \"While the directional upside remains, investors can no longer expect 10x or 100x returns in a short period. As a result, we’ve seen some long-term holders begin to divest a portion of their BTC holdings to diversify into other asset classes such as equities, gold, and private placements — a move that makes sense from a portfolio allocation perspective,\" Yang told CoinDesk. What next? According to Yang, the market may not offer much excitement in the near-term, as the cryptocurrency continues to trade in tandem with equities and broader risk sentiment. \"Both asset classes are hovering near all-time highs, and if equities break higher, BTC is likely to follow. With the summer lull setting in, market activity is expected to remain subdued in the near term,\" Yang noted. Blume said that the BTC market may cool off a little, having seen prices surge from $75K to over $100K in the early weeks of this quarter. \"It’s also to keep in mind that Bitcoin rallied from 78k less than two months ago, so I’d expect a cool off anyway. It’s telling that the dips in price are quite shallow and are a sign of strength for the next leg up,\" Blume said. According to Thielen, the key levels to watch are $102,000 on the downside and $106,000 on the upside.',\n",

       "  'BODY': \"A Kansas banker who looted millions from his small-town bank in 2023 , which triggered its collapse, lost much of the money to overseas crypto scammers targeted in a record-breaking DOJ bust, according to a complaint filed Wednesday. Prosecutors have filed a civil forfeiture action targeting over $225 million in laundered USDT, part of a butchering scam with ties to a Philippines call center that ensnared Shan Hanes, the disgraced former CEO who embezzled $47 million from Heartland Tri-State Bank , a theft which was directly attributed to the agricultural lender's demise in 2023. According to the Department of Justice complaint , OKX, a crypto exchange, provided key information that helped identify an intricate network of accounts on the exchange used to launder the crypto proceeds. Scammers laundered funds by first directing victims to send USDT to 93 scam-controlled deposit addresses. From there, the funds were routed through as many as 100 intermediary wallets in a process designed to obscure the source of funds and mix deposits from multiple victims, according to the complaint. These laundered funds were then funneled into 22 primary OKX accounts and further shuffled across 122 additional OKX accounts, all linked by shared IP addresses, reused KYC documents, and coordinated behavior allegedly traced to a Manila-based scam compound, which the complaint names as ITECHNO Specialist Inc. In total, the DOJ says that approximately $3 billion in transaction volume was generated by this laundering network. Largest victims In total, the DOJ says there were 434 victims and has identified 60 of them who lost a combined $19.4 million. The largest of these victims was Hanes, with the DOJ identifying $3.3 million of the $47 million he embezzled in this seizure. Hanes embezzled the money between May 30, 2023, and July 7, 2023, according to both the DOJ complaint and the Federal Reserve’s report into the collapse of Heartland Tri-State Bank, one of the banks to collapse in the aftermath of the 2023 U.S. banking crisis. During this six-week period, Hanes initiated 10 wire transfers totaling approximately $47.1 million from Heartland Tri-State Bank, a small community lender focused on agricultural loans, to a crypto wallet he controlled. These wire transfers occurred between the bank’s quarterly regulatory reporting periods, allowing the activity to go initially undetected. At the time, Heartland was well-capitalized with $13.7 million in capital and $139 million in assets, but Hanes' actions depleted its liquidity, triggered $21 million in emergency borrowing, and left the bank with a $35 million capital hole, forcing regulators to shut it down in July 2023. According to prior reporting from CNBC , Hanes also stole $40,000 from the Elkhart Church of Christ, $10,000 from the Santa Fe Investment Club, $60,000 from his daughter’s college fund, and liquidated nearly $1 million in stock from a firm called Elkhart Financial to send to pig butchering scammers. He was sentenced to 24 years in prison in August 2024. The DOJ complaint referred to him as both a perpetrator and a victim. Seized crypto likely going to Fed stockpile Crypto seized by the U.S. government, such as in this case, is likely to be earmarked for a not-yet-established stockpile ordered by President Donald Trump. The bitcoin BTC reserve and the stockpile of other cryptocurrencies haven't yet been formally established, but the Treasury Department has been leading an audit of governmental digital asset holdings to determine what needs to be gathered. Once established, the long-term crypto holdings will likely put seized bitcoin in one fund and other types of tokens in another. The holdings in this case appear to be in significant amounts of USDT, according to the filing. It's unclear what funds may eventually be returned to victims, as only a relatively small percentage of those directly harmed have been identified.\",\n",

       "  'BODY': 'There\\'s a quiet transformation underway in decentralized finance (DeFi). While DeFi\\'s previous bull market was driven by eye-watering—and dubious—yields and speculative frenzy, the current growth has been powered by the sector becoming a backend financial layer for user-facing apps and increasing institutional participation, according to a Wednesday report by analytics firm Artemis and on-chain yield platform Vaults.fyi. The total value locked (TVL) on top DeFi lending protocols—including Aave, Euler, Spark and Morpho—has surged past $50 billion and approaching $60 billion, growing 60% over the past year, the report showed. This growth has been driven by rapid institutionalization and increasingly sophisticated risk management tools. \"These are not merely yield platforms; they are evolving into modular financial networks undergoing rapid institutionalization,\" the authors said. The \\'DeFi mullet\\' One of the key trend recently the report highlighted is user-facing applications quietly embedding DeFi infrastructure in the backend to offer yield or loans. These features are abstracted away from users creating a more seamless experience, a trend often called the \"DeFi mullet:\" fintech front-end, DeFi backend, the report said. Coinbase users, for instance, can borrow against their bitcoin BTC holdings powered by DeFi lender Morpho’s backend infrastructure. More than $300 million in loans have already originated via this integration as of this month, the report pointed out. Bitget Wallet’s integration with lending protocol Aave offers a 5% yield on USDC and USDT holdings across chains without leaving the crypto wallet app. PayPal is also doing something similar with its PYUSD stablecoin, offering yields near 3.7% to PayPal and Venmo wallet users, albeit without the DeFi element. The report said crypto-friendly fintech firms with large user bases, such as Robinhood or Revolut, may also adopt this strategy and offer services like stablecoin credit lines and asset-backed loans through DeFi markets, creating new fee-based revenue streams. Tokenized RWAs in DeFi Increasingly, DeFi protocols are introducing use cases for tokenized versions of traditional instruments such as U.S. Treasuries and credit funds, also known as real-world assets (RWA). These tokenized assets can serve as collateral, earn yield directly or be bundled into more complex strategies. Read more: Tokenized Apollo Credit Fund Makes DeFi Debut With Levered-Yield Strategy by Securitize, Gauntlet Tokenization of investment strategies is also becoming popular. Pendle, a protocol that lets users split yield streams from principal, now manages over $4 billion in total value locked, much of it in tokenized stablecoin yield products. Meanwhile, Ethena’s sUSDe and similar yield-bearing tokens have introduced products that deliver returns above 8% through strategies like cash-and-carry trades, all while abstracting away the operational burden for the end user. Rise of on-chain asset managers A less visible but critical trend highlighted in the report is the rise of crypto-native asset managers. Firms like Gauntlet, Re7 and Steakhouse Financial allocate capital across DeFi ecosystems using professionally managed strategies, resembling the role of traditional asset managers. These players are deeply embedded in DeFi protocol governance, fine-tune risk parameters and deploy capital across a range of structured yield products, tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and modular lending markets. The report noted that the sector’s capital under management has grown fourfold since January—from $1 billion to over $4 billion. Read more: Crypto for Advisors: DeFi Yields, the Revival',\n",

      "Column: BODY, Type: object, Sample: Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. After a tense weekend that saw the U.S. bomb an Iranian nuclear site , bitcoin btc has regained its footing, hovering around $106K as Asia begins its Wednesday session and pushing past levels from earlier this month when Israel bombed Iran . Part of the reason why crypto has recovered alongside traditional markets is just how correlated the two have become. \"Bitcoin’s sensitivity to traditional asset classes and macroeconomic indicators has evolved markedly over the past few market cycles, reflecting its growing integration into the broader macro-financial system,\" a recent report from Glassnode and Avenir Group reads. \"Institutional infrastructure has reshaped how capital engages with bitcoin. As a result, its market behavior is increasingly governed by structural liquidity, long-horizon positioning, and regulated access points.\" That institutional backbone was visible again this week. Semir Gabeljic, director of capital formation and investment strategy at Pythagoras Investments, cited ETF flows as a major tailwind: \"The huge recent capital inflows in Bitcoin ETFs of $1.1 billion last week and even $350 million today alone\" are driving the positive trend. Spencer Yang, Core Contributor to Fractal Bitcoin, added that one of the reasons why BTC was able to shake off war jitters so quickly is that fundamentally, nothing has changed about the asset class due to the conflict in the Middle East. All the metrics that investors would look to for BTC are still there, and other bullish market sentiment is possibly on the way. “We’re seeing continued interest in protocols like BRC-20, especially with the recent upgrade, as well as Runes and Alkanes, which have been getting a lot of attention,\" he added. \"So overall, on‑chain activity across the board is increasing thanks to these types of assets.” The takeaway? As bitcoin becomes increasingly defined by institutional demand and macro liquidity cycles, analysts see its price action as less about reacting to headlines and more about long-term capital commitment. This structural shift is what continues to anchor BTC above $100K, despite the noise. Tim Draper: Bitcoin Is Eating Crypto as Innovation Flocks to BTC The Bitcoin blockchain is becoming the new home for crypto innovation, absorbing ideas once exclusive to altcoins, just as Microsoft once consolidated the software revolution under its operating system empire, Tim Draper argued in a recent post on X . Draper pointed to BTC dominance , a metric equivalent to its \"market share,\" rising over 60%,up from 40% after the 2017 boom-bust cycle and 50% following the 2021 peak, as proof that Bitcoin is reasserting control over the broader crypto ecosystem. Much like how Microsoft integrated or cloned early success stories like Lotus 1-2-3, WordPerfect, and PowerPoint to form its software suite, Draper says Bitcoin is now incorporating once-altcoin-exclusive innovations: smart contracts, DeFi, ordinals, and low-cost layer 2s. “All the successful innovations on other platforms are now being ported to Bitcoin,” Draper wrote, calling it an “acceleration” that mirrors Big Tech consolidation. Developers, he said, are increasingly gravitating toward Bitcoin as the most secure and valuable chain. Draper, who runs a Bitcoin-focused accelerator with Boost VC, said the next generation of entrepreneurs is building on Bitcoin not just for ideological reasons, but because the infrastructure and ecosystem are now ready. “Smart entrepreneurs are always building on the platform with the strongest gravitational pull,” he wrote. “That platform is Bitcoin.” WazirX Granted Extension to Present Revised Restructuring Plan WazirX has received a court-approved extension from the Singapore High Court , allowing it to present further arguments in support of its proposed Scheme of Arrangement. The court also extended the moratorium on creditor actions, which will now remain in place until a ruling is issued on the revised plan. In a statement released Monday, the exchange said it is awaiting further directions from the court and reiterated its commitment to resolving outstanding claims. The company’s original restructuring plan, rejected by the court last month, as CoinDesk previously reported , sought to reimburse users affected by a $234 million hack in July 2024 through the issuance of recovery tokens and a transfer of operations to a new entity, Zensui Corporation. More than 93% of creditors had approved the initial plan, but the court cited concerns around governance and transparency. Without an approved arrangement, WazirX faces the possibility of liquidation under Singapore’s Companies Act, which could lead to extended delays and reduced creditor recoveries. No date has been set for the next court hearing. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin surged past $106,000 after a ceasefire between Israel and Iran eased geopolitical tensions, triggering a breakout fueled by high-conviction buyers, bullish technical signals, and strong on-chain accumulation, while the broader CD20 index also climbed nearly 1% amid renewed market strength. ETH: Ethereum surged 4% to break above $2,450 as Trump’s announcement of an Israel-Iran ceasefire eased global tensions, triggering renewed institutional accumulation and strong on-chain buying momentum. Gold: Gold fell as much as 2% to $3,300 after Trump’s surprise Israel-Iran ceasefire announcement eased geopolitical tensions, weakening safe-haven demand even as the metal remains up over 25% year-to-date. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.12% as Asia-Pacific markets opened higher Wednesday, buoyed by the Israel-Iran ceasefire and new signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve. S&P 500: U.S. stocks surged Tuesday, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hitting their highest levels since February as a tech-led rally gained momentum amid growing optimism over a fragile U.S.-brokered Israel-Iran ceasefire.
